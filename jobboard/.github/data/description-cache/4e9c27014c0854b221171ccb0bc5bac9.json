    "description": "Software Engineer – Systems & Real-Time (RTOS / HIL)Los Angeles, CA / New York, NY / Austin, TXEngineering, Product, Design – Software Engineering /Full-time /On-siteApply for this jobAbout NominalNominal is building the software infrastructure that powers the world’s most advanced hardware systems — from spacecraft and autonomous vehicles to next-generation industrial machines. Our platform ingests high-rate telemetry, validates complex autonomy software in real time, and helps engineering teams iterate faster without sacrificing safety or precision. We’re a small, fast-moving team of engineers and operators who own problems end-to-end, work across disciplines, and thrive on solving challenges at the intersection of hardware and software. As a dual-use platform, we're serving top-tier commercial and defense customers, including the U.S. Navy, United States Air Force, Shield AI, and Anduril.We’re backed by top-tier investors — Sequoia, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lux Capital, and Lightspeed Ventures — who share our mission to accelerate innovation in mission-critical systems. Our team brings experience from SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition, and other leading companies, united by a common goal: enabling hardware engineers to push the boundaries of advanced technology with speed, safety, and precision.As a Systems-Level Software Engineer, you’ll architect and implement the real-time backbone of Nominal’s test automation and simulation platform. You’ll work across the full stack of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems, from deterministic task scheduling and bus I/O to distributed telemetry and timing synchronization — ensuring our software behaves predictably under the tightest latency budgets. If you thrive at the boundary between software and the physical world — where timing matters as much as correctness, this role is for you.🚀 About the RoleDesign and implement hard real-time components for data acquisition, control, and simulation using C++ and/or Rust.Develop deterministic communication layers for CAN, EtherCAT, serial, and MIL-STD-1553 or similar field buses.Architect the core HIL runtime, including task schedulers, timing controllers, and synchronization primitives.Integrate with embedded targets, flight computers, and sensor networks to validate autonomy and control software.Collaborate with our infrastructure and visualization teams to connect real-time execution with distributed telemetry, playback, and analysis pipelines.Profile, benchmark, and harden low-latency systems to meet microsecond-level timing guarantees.Establish testing and verification standards for real-time correctness and timing determinism across the platform.⚡ Skills That Accelerate Us4+ years of systems-level or embedded software development in C++ (C++17 or newer) or Rust, with a deep understanding of real-time constraints and deterministic scheduling.Experience with RTOSs such as QNX, RTEMS, FreeRTOS, VxWorks, or Linux PREEMPT-RT.Background in HIL or SIL testing, real-time control loops, or simulation frameworks for aerospace, automotive, or robotics.Strong grasp of hardware interfaces, timing jitter, interrupt handling, and low-level I/O.Familiarity with signal acquisition, control systems, and sensor fusion concepts.Bonus: experience with LabVIEW, NI TestStand, PXI/DAQ systems, or integration with external test equipment.Bonus: knowledge of time-synchronized networking (PTP/NTP), DDS, or real-time middleware (ROS 2, RTI Connext).Ability to debug at multiple layers — from driver-level to distributed telemetry — and to reason clearly about timing and causality.✨ Benefits/Perks🏥 100% coverage of medical, dental, and vision insurance🏖️ Unlimited PTO and sick leave🍽️ Free lunch, snacks, and coffee🚀 Professional Development Stipend✈️ Annual company retreat$120,000 - $150,000 a yearThis wide band reflects the range of experience levels we’re open to, from 2 years to 15+ years. Your specific compensation will be determined on a case-by-case basis, factoring in your skills, experience, and the level at which you join. OTE includes both base salary and performance-based commissions. In addition to cash compensation, eligible employees receive competitive equity grants in the form of stock options, providing the opportunity to share in Nominal’s long-term success.All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.ITAR RequirementsTo conform to U.S. Government export regulations, applicant must be a (i) U.S. citizen or national, (ii) U.S. lawful, permanent resident (aka green card holder), (iii) Refugee under 8 U.S.C. § 1157, or (iv) Asylee under 8 U.S.C. § 1158, or be eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
