That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002. </p> <p>To learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit <a href=\"https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet\">https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet</a>.</p> <p>By providing your information, you acknowledge that you want Roku to contact you about job roles, that you have read Roku's <a href=\"https://www.weareroku.com/roku-job-applicant-privacy-notice-for-job-applicants\">Applicant Privacy Notice</a>, and understand that Roku will use your information as described in that notice.
