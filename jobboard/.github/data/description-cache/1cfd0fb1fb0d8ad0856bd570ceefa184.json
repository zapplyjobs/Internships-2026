    "description": "About Virtru: While the rest of the security industry obsesses over locking data down to prevent it from being lost or stolen, we're doing something fundamentally different at Virtru. We're setting data free so that you can intentionally share it with others, but without sacrificing security, privacy, or control. We've created both a suite of powerful data protection applications and an open platform that's sparking an ecosystem of innovation. Through the Trusted Data Format (TDF) open standard, we're not just protecting data; we're creating a new paradigm where security enables sharing rather than preventing it. Think of us as the Android of data protection: a robust platform with an open core that developers and partners can build upon, coupled with our own best-in-class applications that showcase what's possible when you reimagine security from the ground up. Backed by Iconiq Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Foundry Capital, and Tiger Global, we're helping Fortune 500 companies and government agencies discover that true data security means having the freedom to share, collaborate, and innovate — without compromise.This is a paid Summer 2026 Internship.
