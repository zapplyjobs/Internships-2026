    "description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: As the Head of Revenue Analytics at Gusto, you will lead a critical function responsible for using data to measure, analyze, and optimize the drivers of our Go-to-Market revenue. Reporting to the Head of Revenue Operations, you will be a strategic partner to our GTM and Product teams, using a deep understanding of customer behavior and market trends to drive growth, retention, and profitability. You will lead a team of Gusties responsible for revenue forecasting, marketing analytics, and customer expansion insights, working cross-functionally with Sales, Marketing, Finance, Data, and Product to guide Gusto’s growth strategy. The ideal candidate is an exceptional data leader who can balance strategic vision with hands-on analytical work — someone equally comfortable shaping forecasts at the executive level and rolling up their sleeves to build reports or run ad-hoc analyses when needed. What You'll Do: Strategic Leadership: Develop and execute a comprehensive revenue analytics strategy that aligns with GTM’s overall business goals. Partner with GTM and R&D leaders to provide the data and insights needed to make informed, data-driven decisions. Forecasting & Planning: Lead the design and execution of revenue forecasts across acquisition, expansion, and retention. Provide Finance and GTM leaders with accurate, transparent, and actionable views of performance. Marketing Analytics: Drive analysis of acquisition efficiency, ROI, attribution, and customer lifecycle value to optimize spend and guide strategic bets. Customer & Retention Insights: Deliver churn, retention, and CLV analysis to inform strategies for engagement, upsell, and long-term profitability. Insights and Recommendations: Conduct deep-dive analyses to identify revenue drivers and anomalies. Translate complex data into clear, actionable insights and recommendations for senior leadership and cross-functional partners. Quota & Budget Alignment: Partner with Finance and GTM leaders to support quota setting, budget allocation, and performance tracking. Data Products & Infrastructure: Build and scale datasets, dashboards, and tools that provide self-serve access to revenue insights while ensuring data quality and consistency. AI-Driven Analytics: Evaluate and apply AI/ML techniques to enhance forecasting, attribution, and customer lifecycle modeling. Stay ahead of emerging AI tools that can drive efficiency and accuracy in revenue analytics. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Serve as a critical partner to Sales Ops, GTM Analytics, Marketing Ops, and Finance in aligning data and insights across the funnel. People Empowerment: Recruit, mentor, and develop a high-performing analytics team. Foster a culture of curiosity, analytical rigor, and operational excellence to deliver impact across the business. What We’re Looking For: 12+ years of experience in analytics, forecasting, or revenue strategy, with at least 5+ years in a leadership role. Leadership with a Builder Mindset: A dynamic leader who inspires and develops teams while maintaining a “roll up your sleeves” attitude — able to step into the details when needed to build reports, run analyses, and troubleshoot. Analytical Expertise: Strong analytical skills with expertise in data analysis and visualization tools (e.g., SQL, Tableau, Power BI). Experience with financial and marketing forecasting models. SaaS/Growth Background: Proven track record of successfully building and leading analytics functions in a high-growth SaaS or technology environment. Technical Skills: Familiarity with various data sources and technologies, including Salesforce, marketing automation platforms, and data warehouses. AI Fluency: Awareness of how AI/ML is transforming analytics, with the ability to partner with data science and engineering teams to pilot and operationalize AI-driven approaches. Skilled at discerning when AI adds value and when traditional methods are more appropriate. Business Acumen: Deep understanding of the entire customer lifecycle, from acquisition to retention, and how each stage impacts revenue. Communication & Influence: Excellent communication and presentation skills with the ability to distill complex data into clear, actionable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences. Compensation Our annual base salary compensation range for this role is $201,200 - $251,500 in San Francisco & New York, and $171,200 - $214,000 in Denver. This role is also eligible for an annual variable cash bonus (up to 20%).
