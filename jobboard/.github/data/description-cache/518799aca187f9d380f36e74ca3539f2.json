    "description": "About Neuralink: We are creating devices that enable a bi-directional interface with the brain. These devices allow us to restore movement to the paralyzed, restore sight to the blind, and revolutionize how humans interact with their digital world.Team Description: The Robot Optics Team is passionate about shaping the future of operating rooms. We are responsible for all optical engineering aspects of Neuralink surgeries, including working on our surgical robotics, supporting operating room equipment, and manufacturing custom consumables. The core device we work on is the robotic system that performs implant insertions. Key subsystems include 2D and 3D machine vision cameras, optical coherence tomography, and surgical site illuminators. Our team oversees the entire product lifecycle of all optical subsystems across multiple robot versions, from ideation and design through production, testing, and maintenance. We also design hardware for producing and inspecting consumables, such as laser-machined needle cartridges. As we manufacture a significant portion of our hardware in-house, our core activities include bring-up testing, designing hardware acceptance testers, and overseeing manufacturing processes. Job Description and Responsibilities: As a Robot Optics Intern at Neuralink, you will build, characterize, and calibrate optical and optomechanical systems used directly in our surgical robots and associated consumables manufacturing systems. These systems are responsible for everything from sub-micron conventional imaging to laser scanning imaging to non-imaging optical power delivery. In this role, you will be expected to: Design and simulate optical imaging systems Test, verify, and maintain vision systems in robots Repair and troubleshoot existing optical subassemblies Test and verify optics consumables Develop image acquisition and processing software Conduct preliminary tests of new imaging technologies for robotic surgeries Collaborate with engineering teams to evaluate and implement process improvements Prepare relevant documentation and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for robot optics Required Qualifications: Familiarity with basic optics fundamentals such as aberrations, transmission/reflection, light polarization, Gaussian beams, etc. Experience with visible and IR optical equipment (e.g., fiber splicers, light sources, beam profilers, power meters, resolution targets) 1+ years of optical engineering experience, including simulation and design of optics in Zemax or equivalent software 1+ years of relevant industrial experience with assembly, precision alignment, and integration of complex optomechanical systems 1+ years of experience with benchtop testing, performance characterization, and metrology benchmarking of optical systems Experience documenting and following procedures in the optical design pipeline (e.g., assembly, characterization, verification) with a high level of detail Preferred Qualifications: Strong understanding of engineering first principles Education in an engineering-related field Experience with data analysis and image processing Experience with optics alignment and optics bench testing Experience with fiber optics fabrication Mechanical engineering and CAD skills Experience with optical simulation and design software (e.g., Zemax, CodeV, OSLO, LightTools) Additional Requirements and Competencies: Ability to travel to and work in Fremont, CA Basic computer skills and proficiency in Google Docs, Google Drive, and Gmail Software engineering experience in developing scripts for instrument testing Comfortable working in laboratory and vivarium environments as needed Pay Transparency: Based on California law, the following details are for California individuals only. California Hourly Rate: $35/Hr USD What We Offer: Full-time employees are eligible for the following benefits listed below. An opportunity to change the world and work with some of the smartest and most talented experts from different fields Growth potential; we rapidly advance team members who have an outsized impact Excellent medical, dental, and vision insurance through a PPO plan Paid holidays Commuter benefits Meals provided Equity (RSUs) *Temporary Employees & Interns excluded 401(k) plan *Interns initially excluded until they work 1,000 hours Parental leave *Temporary Employees & Interns excluded Flexible time off *Temporary Employees & Interns excluded",
