    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>The DTT Co-Op Program offers participants a unique environment to learn Chick-fil-A’s business, culture, and technology in a safe and supportive environment. The program is committed to developing participants personally and professionally through hands-on experience, workshops, mentorship, and project work. Participants have the opportunity to explore both technical and functional tracks, enabling cross-functional skill development. This is a 3 semester Co-Op operating on a non-sequential, every other-semester, basis. The 1st semester is the Foundations semester for Co-Ops where participants will gain hands-on learning and project experience. The 2nd and 3rd semesters are apprenticeship semesters where Co-Ops are embedded into a team alongside a coach. Co-Ops will rotate college coursework between each semester they serve with Chick-fil-A, Inc. The DTT Co-Op is a separate program from Chick-fil-A’s traditional, fall internship program.</p> <ul> <li>This is a paid opportunity</li> <li>Only full-time opportunities are available (Co-Ops are encouraged to not take coursework while working)</li> <li>Must commit to working 3 semesters for Chick-fil-A</li> <li>Must have at least 3 semesters of college coursework remaining before graduation and must be pursuing an undergraduate degree in a technical field</li> </ul> <p>Hiring for both Technical and Functional roles.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>C1 (first semester of the Co-Op): All DTT C1s complete a 4-5 week bootcamp, upskilling them on relevant skills to help them succeed in project work. C1s serve on teams together to complete two different projects for the remainder of the semester. Possibility to serve in both technical and functional capacities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>C2 (second semester of the Co-Op): Co-Ops are assigned to a project team based on their interest, project impact, business objectives, and team needs. At this stage, Co-Ops select either the engineer or analyst track. Co-Ops are embedded onto an existing project team and contribute directly to that team’s goals and initiatives. All teams in our department are eligible to request a Co-Op, so any Chick-fil-A technology is a candidate for a Co-Op project. Function as a junior career member of the team.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>C3 (third semester of the Co-Op): Option to remain on current team or try something new. It is virtually the same as C2. Participants are partnered with an Early Talent Coach to support their initiatives. Function as a junior career member of the team.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Digital Transformation &amp; Technology (DTT) Co-Op will have the opportunity to:</p> <ul> <li>Leverage cloud technologies to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable products</li> <li>Develop proficiency in programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go</li> <li>Build impactful technology that serves staff, customers, operators, or team members</li> <li>Cultivate relationships across technical and functional peers and Chick-fil-A Technology leadership</li> <li>Solve business critical problems by serving on a team to build innovative solutions</li> <li>Participants are paired with an Early Talent Coach for the duration of each semester. Early Talent Coaches are a Co-Op's go-to resource for support, work direction, and input</li> </ul> <p>This program gives participants the opportunity to leverage programming and project management skills in a real-life working environment. Participants get to experience first-hand Chick-fil-A’s corporate culture and participate in a range of DTT projects. Participants are presented with leadership opportunities while gaining key skills and perspective necessary for a successful career in DTT at Chick-fil-A, Inc. or in DTT more broadly.
