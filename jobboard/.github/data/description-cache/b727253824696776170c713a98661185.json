We’re a small, fast-moving team of engineers and operators with deep experience from companies like SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, and Applied Intuition. We’re backed by Sequoia, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lux Capital, and Lightspeed Ventures — and we serve a range of top-tier commercial and defense customers, including the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Shield AI, and Anduril.
