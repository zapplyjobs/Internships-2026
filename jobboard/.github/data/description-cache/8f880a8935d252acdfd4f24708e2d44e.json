    "description": "Research Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world&#39;s best researchers, Research Interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Research Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, Research Interns are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other Research Interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer. Investigate emerging AI system architectures and analyze how hardware, software, and model behavior interact across large-scale inference workloads. Develop and evaluate analytical or simulation-based performance models to identify system bottlenecks, scalability limits, and optimization opportunities. Prototype or assess new inference mechanisms, including disaggregated execution, sparse/expert model scaling, and hierarchical attention techniques. Explore next-generation accelerator, memory-architecture, and interconnect technologies, assessing their architectural trade-offs and cost implications. Conduct experiments, synthesize research findings, and communicate results to mentors and collaborating researchers. Collaborate with fellow interns and researchers to advance new ideas in AI systems and architectural design. Currently enrolled in a PhD program in Computer Science, Electrical/Computer Engineering, or a related field. In addition to the qualifications below, you&#39;ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position as well as a cover letter and any relevant work or research samples. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf. Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance, so they will be ready to submit your letter. Research experience in areas such as computer architecture, AI/ML systems, performance modeling, distributed systems, or hardware-software co-design. Programming skills in Python, C/C++ with experience building prototypes, simulators, or performance analysis tools. Familiarity with modern AI workloads and/or deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). Demonstrated ability to define and pursue original research directions in AI systems or architecture. Ability to collaborate effectively with researchers across disciplines and work in cross-group, cross-cultural environments. Proficient communication and presentation skills for sharing complex technical insights. Ability to think creatively and approach system and architecture challenges with unconventional or innovative solutions. Experience with PyTorch, CUDA, Triton, or performance-simulation tools. Background in large-scale system design, AI inference bottleneck analysis, or modeling cost/performance tradeoffs. Understanding of accelerator, memory-system, or interconnect design principles.",
