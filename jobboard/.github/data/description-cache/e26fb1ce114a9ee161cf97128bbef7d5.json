We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.People come to Discord before, during, and after gaming, and we want to make that experience even better. Working directly with our developer partners and communities, we are building brand new ways for users on Discord to connect, engage and have a great time while gaming.
