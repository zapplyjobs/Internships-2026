    "description": "<h2>Division</h2>Steel Dynamics <h2>Overview</h2> <p><strong>What Does Steel Dynamics Do?</strong></p> <p>Steel Dynamics is a leading industrial metals solutions company that produces lower-carbon, high-quality steel products primarily from recycled scrap. Operating through a circular manufacturing model, the company manufactures a wide range of steel products including flat roll, structural, and long products for industries such as construction, automotive, energy, and manufacturing. In addition to steel production, Steel Dynamics operates metals recycling facilities, steel fabrication plants, and aluminum production operations, serving customers across North America with a focus on innovation, efficiency, and sustainability.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What Makes This Internship Different?</strong>Steel Dynamics’ mechanical engineering internships stand out from those at other companies because they offer a true balance of office-based engineering work and hands-on industrial experience. Interns are not limited to observing from a distance, they actively work alongside operators and maintenance teams on the production floor, applying engineering principles directly to equipment, systems, and processes. This approach allows interns to design solutions, test them in real-world conditions, and see the immediate impact of their work. By combining technical analysis, CAD design, and process improvement projects with practical mechanical maintenance, Steel Dynamics provides interns with a unique opportunity to develop both engineering expertise and practical skills that are highly valued in the industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Internship Location</strong></p> <p>This internship is located at the Steel Dynamics Butler Flat Roll Division located in Butler, IN, in the Cold Mill Department.
