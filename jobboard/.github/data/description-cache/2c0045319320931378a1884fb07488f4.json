About the Role: Gusto is seeking motivated, customer-centric professionals interested in being considered for future sales and onboarding opportunities in 2026. These roles are ideal for early-career sales talent who thrive in a fast-paced, consultative environment and are passionate about helping small businesses succeed. As a member of our Sales or Onboarding teams, you’ll own customer experience from first conversation through successful adoption—helping small businesses select Gusto and navigate their first steps with us. You’ll handle inbound calls and chats while potentially engaging in some outbound outreach to prospective or current customers. Through empathy, problem-solving, and advisory selling, you’ll make an immediate impact on how our customers experience Gusto from day one. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Handle high-volume inbound calls, chats, and emails from customers or partners at various stages of their journey—from discovery to onboarding. Serve as a trusted advisor, helping small businesses or accounting partners select the right Gusto solutions for their needs. Support customers through the onboarding process to ensure a smooth and successful start. Demonstrate strong product knowledge and a commitment to ethical, customer-first selling. Maintain accurate notes and pipeline details in Salesforce to ensure excellent follow-through. Positions available in the future range levels. Here’s what we're looking for: 1–3 years of experience in a sales or customer service role. Experience working in high-volume environments that include inbound and outbound calling. Proven success achieving or exceeding goals and maintaining strong customer relationships. A passion for consultative, solution-oriented selling and helping small businesses succeed. Comfortable using Salesforce or similar CRM systems. This posting represents a general talent pipeline that spans multiple levels within our Sales team. Final compensation will be determined based on the specific role, level, and experience alignment. The estimated compensation range for these roles is $20.00–$28.00 per hour. Please note that these positions do not include a commission structure. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale. Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas. When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required. This includes non-office days for hybrid employees. Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger.
