    "description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Opportunity Editing and motion are where our stories truly take shape. Pacing, sound, motion, and color aren’t finishing touches—they’re the work. They’re how we earn trust, convey clarity, and make people feel something. Gusto is expanding our in-house creative studio inside our fast-moving, late-stage startup. We make cinematic brand films, product stories, and customer-driven narratives—and we also partner closely with our social team to bring those stories to life where our audience spends time. It’s common to shift between a polished long-form piece and fast-turn social work in the same week. We’re looking for a Staff Motion Designer who is a hands-on maker: someone who loves editing and motion design, takes real ownership of the final product, and wants to help shape how video and motion show up across our brand. This is a senior individual contributor role, focused on post-production craft and storytelling. In this role, you’ll own the motion and edit from rough cut through final delivery. You’ll make judgment calls about pacing, sound, animation, and color. You’ll collaborate closely with other creatives and cross-functional partners on our marketing team to produce great work that defines our brand and that has an impact. And you’ll help us raise the bar while also making the work easier to scale—through better workflows, smarter templates, and mindful use of modern tools. If you’re energized by being close to the work, care deeply about taste, and enjoy improving both the output and the process, this role will be a top-notch fit. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day Edit brand films, product stories, interviews, explainers, and social-first content Design motion graphics, typography, transitions, and animation that serve the story—not the other way around Shape expressive arcs through pacing, sound design, and color Partner closely with other creatives and cross-functional partners from our marketing, comms and social teams from rough cut through final delivery Build repeatable templates and workflows that enable faster turnaround without sacrificing quality Use modern editing and motion tools—including AI-enabled workflows—to explore, iterate, and produce more proficiently Keep post-production organized and deliver final assets that meet creative and technical standards Here’s what we’re looking for 8+ years of experience editing and designing motion for brand, film, agency, or content studios Expert-level fluency in editing and motion tools, with curiosity and judgment around emerging AI-enabled methods A portfolio that demonstrates robust storytelling, mindful motion design, and range across formats Sharp instincts for sound design, pacing, color, and transitions Comfort shifting between polished, narrative-driven work and fast, social-first content Proficient collaboration skills across creative, production, and marketing partners A maker mindset—you enjoy improving how work gets made, not just making the work itself Compensation Details At Gusto, we strive to provide rewards that empower employees to achieve their financial and personal goals.
