    "description": "Research Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world&#39;s best researchers, Research Interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Research Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, Research Interns are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other Research Interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer. Conduct research on applying AI/Machine Learning(ML)—including LLMs, agentic AI, deep neural networks (DNNs) and/or causal inference—to electricity infrastructure planning and policy-relevant decision problems. Model and analyze real electricity system challenges, such as resource adequacy, load growth forecasting, datacenter siting, permitting workflows, grid flexibility, climate/weather-driven disruptions, transmission expansion, or regulatory impact assessments. Design and implement experiments, prototypes, or simulations using AI methods to support grid planning, permitting streamlining, or policy evaluation. Analyze empirical or model‑based results and contribute to technical reports, publications, or internal decision-support tools. Collect, organize, and preprocess relevant datasets (e.g., grid models, load forecasts, permitting data, climate/weather data) to support AI-driven electricity infrastructure planning and analysis. Collaborate with mentors and interdisciplinary teams to advance research directions. Present findings and participate in the intellectual life of MSR&#39;s research community. Currently enrolled in a PhD program in Computer Science, Environmental Science, Electrical Engineering (Power Systems), Energy Systems, or a related field. One or more publications or substantial research experience in machine learning, causal inference, energy systems modeling, or related areas. In addition to the qualifications below, you&#39;ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position as well as a cover letter and any relevant work or research samples. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf. Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance, so they will be ready to submit your letter. Proficiency in Python or similar programming languages. Familiarity with power systems tools, energy modeling frameworks, grid datasets, or numerical simulation environments is a plus (but not required). Experience working with large language models, agentic AI, or AI‑assisted reasoning systems. Demostraded problem‑solving, communication, and collaboration skills. Prior research contributions demonstrated through papers, prototypes, datasets, or software. Prior research experience with a grid operator or utility is a plus (but not required).",
