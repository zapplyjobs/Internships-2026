Our team operates as applied researchers who ship: we prototype quickly, evaluate rigorously (offline metrics and online experiments), and partner closely with product and engineering to bring models to production. We care deeply about helpfulness, safety, and fairness, including domain‑specific, fair‑housing‑aware evaluation, and we invest in modern ML platforms, data governance, and observability to run at national scale.
