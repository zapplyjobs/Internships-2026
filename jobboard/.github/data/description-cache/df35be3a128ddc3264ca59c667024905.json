We provide strategic advice and guidance to all Brex teams, protect Brex, advise on risk, and represent the company externally, negotiating with partners and interacting with regulators.

We are a hybrid environment that combines the energy and connections of being in the office with the benefits and flexibility of working from home. We currently require a minimum of two coordinated days in the office per week, Wednesday and Thursday. Starting February 2, 2026, we will require three days per week in office - Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. As a perk, we also have up to four weeks per year of fully remote work!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What you&amp;#39;ll do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Legal Operations team is a foundational partner to Brex. We create the systems, data practices, and operational infrastructure that enable Legal to operate with clarity, speed, and strategic impact.

This leader will serve as an operational extension of the General Counsel, guiding how Legal plans, executes, and scales in support of a rapidly growing and highly regulated business. The role requires someone who can balance near-term execution with long-term design, operate with a strong bias toward action, and build systems that create leverage across the organization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This role is ideal for an operator who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys building from first principles, and is energized by helping leadership teams move faster and operate more effectively. While grounded in Legal Operations, the scope of this role is expected to evolve as the company grows and the Legal organization interfaces more deeply with other parts of the business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This position reports to the General Counsel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set the strategic direction for Legal Operations, designing and implementing the operating model, workflows, and systems required to support a modern, high-performing Legal organization&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Serve as a trusted operational partner and force multiplier to the General Counsel, supporting planning, prioritization, execution, and leadership cadence across the Legal team&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Design and scale how legal work flows through the organization, reducing friction, accelerating time to resolution, and enabling greater self-service for internal partners&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lead the evolution of the legal technology ecosystem, partnering with Legal, IT, and cross-functional teams to implement and continuously improve CLM, matter management, e-billing, and AI-enabled tools — with a strong focus on outcomes, adoption, and ROI rather than tool administration alone&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Drive experimentation and iteration with emerging technologies, including AI and automation, taking a pragmatic, test-and-learn approach to increasing efficiency and impact&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Own legal department financial operations, including budgeting, forecasting, accruals, vendor management, and cost optimization, in close partnership with Finance and Procurement&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Rationalize and manage outside counsel and vendor relationships, driving consolidation, clear engagement models, and cost discipline while maintaining high-quality outcomes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Develop and operationalize meaningful metrics and insights, translating data into clear narratives that help Legal leadership and the broader business understand workload, performance, cost drivers, and impact&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Build durable knowledge management and enablement systems, including documentation, onboarding pathways, training materials, and self-service resources that allow the organization to scale without proportional headcount growth&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Requirements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Demonstrated experience building or scaling legal operations, business operations, or similar functions in a high-growth environment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proven ability to design and implement systems, processes, and operating models in ambiguous or evolving environments&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong financial and analytical capabilities, including experience with budgeting, forecasting, vendor management, and translating data into executive-level insights&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience leading or partnering on legal technology initiatives (e.g., CLM, e-billing, workflow automation), with the ability to quickly learn new tools and drive adoption&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Track record of influencing and partnering effectively with senior leaders and cross-functional stakeholders&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong bias toward action, iteration, and continuous improvement, balanced with sound judgment and change management skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with a collaborative, low-ego leadership style&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bonus Points&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience operating in a role adjacent to senior leadership (e.g., chief of staff, head of operations, or similar)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exposure to AI-enabled tools or automation platforms in Legal or adjacent functions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;JD or MBA is helpful but not required&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Compensation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The expected salary range for this role is $220,000-$261,000 USD.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the starting base pay will depend on a number of factors, including the candidate’s location, skills, experience, market demands, and internal pay parity.
