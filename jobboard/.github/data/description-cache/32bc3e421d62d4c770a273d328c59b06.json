    "description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About the Role: Vercel’s v0 is redefining how teams design, prototype, and ship with AI. As more of our business moves through sales-led and sales-assisted motions, we need a dedicated product marketer to arm our sales team with the positioning, stories, and assets that convert enterprise interest into deals. This role sits at the intersection of product, sales, and marketing — translating v0’s value into language and tools that resonate with buyers, accelerate cycles, and close business.

Partner closely with sales and solutions engineering to refine messaging based on real deal feedback. Equip AEs and SEs with talk tracks, objection handling, and differentiated positioning for v0 in AI-driven workflows. Market and customer insight Watch the market, spot the gaps, and package the insights so sales can move deals faster. Build buyer personas and decision-making maps for v0’s priority segments within the sales-assisted pipeline. Leverage win/loss analysis to continuously refine messaging and collateral. Launch and adoption support Collaborate with product on sales-facing launch plans for new v0 features, ensuring sales is enabled on day one. Create industry-specific solution briefs and use case narratives that speak to vertical buyer needs. Work with demand generation to ensure campaign messaging aligns with what resonates in sales cycles. Cross-functional leadership Be the go-to bridge between v0 product, marketing, and sales. Translate complex product capabilities into clear business outcomes for non-technical buyers. Partner with customer success to gather post-sale insights that feed back into sales enablement.
