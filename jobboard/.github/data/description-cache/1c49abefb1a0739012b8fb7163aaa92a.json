We’re building the world’s first healthcare‑only, safety‑focused LLM — a breakthrough platform designed to transform patient outcomes at a global scale. This is category creation. Work with the people shaping the future. Hippocratic AI was co‑founded by CEO Munjal Shah and a team of physicians, hospital leaders, AI pioneers, and researchers from institutions like El Camino Health, Johns Hopkins, Washington University in St. Louis, Stanford, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. Backed by the world’s leading healthcare and AI investors. We recently raised a $126M Series C at a $3.5B valuation, led by Avenir Growth, bringing total funding to $404M with participation from CapitalG, General Catalyst, a16z, Kleiner Perkins, Premji Invest, UHS, Cincinnati Children’s, WellSpan Health, John Doerr, Rick Klausner, and others. Build alongside the best in healthcare and AI. Join experts who’ve spent their careers improving care, advancing science, and building world‑changing technologies — ensuring our platform is powerful, trusted, and truly transformative. Location Requirement We believe the best ideas happen together. To support fast collaboration and a strong team culture, this role is expected to be in our Palo Alto office five days a week, unless otherwise specified. About the Role Join Hippocratic AI’s Agent Deployment Engineering Residency as a Junior Agent Deployment Engineer. You’ll help build and tune the conversation layer that powers safe, fully autonomous clinical dialogues—combining Python-driven tooling with advanced prompting to orchestrate agentic workflows. This is an on-site role in Palo Alto, CA, with an initial 3-month term, $55/hour, and top performers will be offered extensions or full-time roles. What You’ll Do Design, implement, and iterate prompting strategies within our state-of-the-art conversation planning layer to enable end-to-end agentic workflows. Partner with Product, Engineering, Model, and Deployment Architecture teams to deliver autonomous, patient-oriented clinical conversations that meet safety and quality bars. Author and maintain reusable prompt patterns, guards, and fallbacks to improve reliability, clinical safety, and user experience. Run targeted experiments (A/Bs and offline evals), analyze outputs, and use findings to optimize prompts, flows, and tooling. Contribute lightweight Python utilities and configs that instrument, evaluate, and ship agents quickly and safely. What You Bring Must- Have: Bachelor’s in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related field (or equivalent coursework/projects). Proficiency with Python and comfort building small tools/CLI scripts. Hands-on LLM prompting experience (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) in professional or personal projects. Strong problem-solving skills and a willingness to learn in a fast-moving environment. Nice-to-Have: Backend project experience (personal, academic, or internship). Exposure to databases and RESTful APIs. Foundational understanding of AI/ML concepts—or a strong desire to learn. Familiarity with modern web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django, or Spring Boot). Awareness of data privacy and security best practices in regulated settings (healthcare a plus). Please be aware of recruitment scams impersonating Hippocratic AI.
