Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're looking for engineers to join a new effort building AI-powered products and capabilities for cybersecurity. You'll work across the stack to prototype new ideas and build from the ground up. This role sits at the intersection of research, product, and go-to-market. You'll work closely with research teams to develop new model capabilities for security applications, prototype and iterate quickly to validate ideas, and engage directly with customers and partners to inform what we build. The right candidate has the technical depth to engage with research, the product instincts to know what's worth building, and the drive to move fast. Responsibilities Prototype and build new AI-powered products for cybersecurity Iterate quickly based on customer feedback and what you learn Collaborate with research teams to identify and develop new model capabilities for security applications Engage directly with customers and partners to understand workflows and inform product direction You may be a good fit if you: Have 7+ years of experience as a software engineer Experience developing cybersecurity products Enjoy fast iteration and are energized by prototyping new ideas Have strong product instincts and enjoy defining what to build, not just how to build it Are comfortable working closely with research and go-to-market teams Have strong communication skills and can work effectively across functions Strong candidates may also have: Experience in incident response, reverse engineering, network analysis, penetration testing, or similar fields Experience working with AI/ML models and building products on top of them Experience building agentic applications Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
