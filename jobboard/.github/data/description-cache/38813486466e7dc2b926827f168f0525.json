    "description": "About Air Space Intelligence ASI's mission-critical technology powers decision-making across aviation, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure domains. Backed by top-tier investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital, and Renegade Partners, ASI delivers operational decision superiority—compressing days of analysis into seconds of action. ASI is leading the way and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. What you’ll do: As a Software Engineering Intern, you’ll be an integral part of our team, solving some of the most complex challenges across complex operating domains such as aerospace and defense. From optimizing routes to detecting anomalies and driving operational efficiency, you’ll contribute to mission-critical solutions that make a real-world impact, all while gaining valuable technical experience and receiving mentorship from leading software engineers. You’ll also have the opportunity to work with the latest technologies, including Rust, React, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Big Query, and Dataflow, gaining hands-on experience in the most sought-after tech skills. What we value: Passionate Builders - We’re looking for talented engineers who love to build. Building isn’t a job, it’s a lifestyle. Our stack includes Python, Rust, and React — whether you already know them or are eager to learn, you’ll thrive if you love solving hard problems and shipping great products. Fast Learners - We don’t expect you to do it all day one, but we do expect that you love to learn and learn quickly. At ASI, speed matters. Critical Thinkers - The world is rapidly changing, and as a result, we must continuously reinvent ourselves to stay ahead and relevant. We love divergent thinkers and people who will come in and challenge the status quo. Force Multipliers - Being excellent in a silo is only part of the equation - to thrive at ASI is to be collaborative and positive-sum oriented. Futurists - You’re energized by the fact that software engineering is being redefined in real time. You seek out new tools and paradigms, including AI, and use them deliberately to compound your impact — without sacrificing technical depth, ownership or taste. Logistics: Our summer internships will be a 12 week engagement starting in June concluding in August We are an in-office work environment thus you must be willing to be onsite in our Boston headquarters You must be graduating at the end of 2026 or in 2027 You must be eligible for a security clearance How we hire: To apply, simply fill out the application and be sure to answer all questions! We look at the interview process not as a screening or test, but rather as an opportunity to simulate what it would look like working together. We build the interview process around you.",
