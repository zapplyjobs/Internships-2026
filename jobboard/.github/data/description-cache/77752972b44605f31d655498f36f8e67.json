    "description": "Figma is growing our team of passionate creatives and builders on a mission to make design accessible to all. Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you're brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us! Our Creation Engine teams work on some of the core technologies that power our real time, browser-based Figma Design and FigJam products. These teams work mostly (but not exclusively) on client-side code that runs in the browser. Under the hood, Figma shares a lot of similarities to a game engine. We develop this C++/WebAssembly engine to ensure internal and external developers can rapidly build new products and features that are fast and reliable by default, and own areas such as our in-memory data model (SceneGraph), renderer, and multiplayer client/server protocols. Within Creation Engine's Rendering & Animation org, the Pixel Engine team focuses on platform level work for a mix of rendering and media support at Figma. Pixel Engine works on the rendering engine, and builds new primitives and features to support new company efforts. The Pixel Engine team is looking for engineers with domain expertise in Media processing and playback.

What you’ll do at Figma: Work closely with teammates and partners in Engineering, Product, Design, Marketing, User Research, and Data Science to build new features and achieve roadmap goals.

Some efforts you might impact include: Supporting new client-side Media features (e.g. image processing pipelines) Improving the performance of media use cases (such as Image and Video) within the rendering engine End-to-end client support of new codecs/compression algorithms Error handling and network retry logicInterface with the rendering engine in scenarios of image and video rendering Drive guidance, quality, and standards for rendering at Figma, and explore opportunities that keep us on the bleeding edge of new capability and advancements. Be a mentor and provide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and benefit from strong personal and professional mentorship opportunities yourself. Contribute to org-wide initiatives like new hire onboarding, interview process development, and Belonging/Equity/Inclusion efforts. Continue ramping and learning. The technical challenges you'll tackle on the Pixel Engine team are unique, fun, ambitious, and ever-evolving.
