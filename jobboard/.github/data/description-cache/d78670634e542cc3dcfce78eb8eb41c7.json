We're seeking a Brand Designer to join our team. As a Brand Designer at Supabase, you’ll play a crucial role in shaping our visual storytelling across a variety of mediums, including decks, printed materials, YouTube content, and conference assets. Working closely with Marketing, DevRel, Success and Enterprise teams, you’ll bring our ideas to life with compelling visuals that engage our developer community and amplify our brand at conferences, events, swag, and beyond. Your work will have a direct impact on how developers perceive and engage with Supabase, helping to create a cohesive and powerful brand presence across all touch points. You’ll push creative boundaries and set high standards for visual communication that resonates with our audience.

Your contributions will help tell Supabase’s story in a way that is consistent and memorable. We Need: Design Expertise: Proficiency in design tools like Figma, Adobe Creative Suite (like InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop), and presentation tools (like Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint — maybe Figma Slides?).

Resistance to Feedback: Comfort with iterating based on feedback, data, and testing is key. Narrow Focus: Comfort with a variety of projects and adaptability to work across digital, print, and video is essential. Feature-Only Mindset: We prioritize cohesive storytelling and visual impact over isolated, unconnected designs.
