    "description": "PositionAmentum Advanced Solutions (AS) is a performance unit of Amentum Engineering & Technology Line of Business. Advanced Solutions specializes in the development, design, construction, and operation of unique and complex research & development, scientific, and test facilities, including wind tunnels (aerospace, DoD, automotive, motorsports, etc.), rocket test stands, climatic chambers, jet engine test cells, acoustic chambers, altitude test facilities, captive trajectory systems, and nuclear facilities. AS projects span the automotive, motorsports, defense, nuclear, and aerospace markets. Recent clients include Audi, Boeing, BMW, Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, Honda, General Motors, NASA, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Department of Energy, and many others across North America, Europe, and Asia.Amentum is looking for a Software Programmer Intern to support projects ranging from small studies to multi-million dollar turn-key supply. A successful candidate must be team-oriented, organized, able to communicate to all levels of the organization, and meet deadlines in a fast-paced environment.Your work will be unique and challenging while supporting several projects in a dynamic and exciting environment. This position will provide you with an unparalleled opportunity to work with a team of motivated programmers, engineers and business professionals who work to ensure client satisfaction and deliver projects within scope, budget, and schedule.We are currently looking for interns to support two different areas, each offering a unique set of challenges.Conventional Test FacilityAmentum is supporting the third phase of an advanced U.S. Navy test facility project, an effort that began over a decade ago and will continue for years to come. This large-scale initiative spans multiple engineering disciplines (process, mechanical, controls, software, structural), giving interns exposure to diverse aspects of engineering and hands-on work with hardware.The software team drives all data acquisition and control room functionality. This includes reading sensor values through NI hardware (cRIO and PXI), streaming data to Redis for real-time GUIs, and storing data in Kafka for long-term analysis. Control room tasks involve building operator interfaces for monitoring, recording, and triggering test sequences, integrating site cameras, and communicating with PLCs to control moving components.About 95% of the code is written in NI LabVIEW, training will be provided at the start of the internship, so no prior experience is required. As an intern, you’ll contribute to both data acquisition and control room development, gaining hands-on experience with LabVIEW, Redis, Kafka, MSSQL, Git, and collaborative software engineering practices.Test SLATE – Advanced Data Acquisition & Control SoftwareTest SLATE is Amentum’s flagship supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software platform, trusted for over 30 years in some of the world’s most advanced test facilities. Originally launched as TestVIEW in 1994, a LabVIEW-based solution, it evolved into Test SLATE in 2006, introducing a modern C# user interface while retaining powerful LabVIEW-driven backend capabilities.Today, Test SLATE is undergoing a major transformation to meet the growing demand for high-speed, large-scale data acquisition. We are transitioning the backend from LabVIEW to open-source technologies like Redis and Kafka, enabling the collection and streaming of hundreds of millions of samples per second. This upgrade supports next-generation aerospace, defense, and automotive testing environments where performance and scalability are critical.With over 600 installations worldwide, Test SLATE integrates data from diverse sources into a single, customizable platform, offering features such as:Real-time data acquisition and visualizationSequencing and automation of complex test eventsSupervisory control and alarm monitoringHistorian and data sharing across distributed operator consolesInterns working on Test SLATE will gain hands-on experience with LabVIEW, Redis, Kafka, C#, and modern software development practices while contributing to a solution deployed in some of the world’s most advanced testing environments, including NASA research facilities and high-performance motorsports wind tunnels.Under the supervision of senior engineering staff, responsibilities include:Develop and test software modules for data acquisition and control systems using LabVIEW, C#, and .NET.Integrate hardware and software for real-time data acquisition platforms (e.g., National Instruments PXI/cRIO).Contribute to relational database management system (RDBMS) development, including schema design, query optimization, and data integration using Microsoft SQL Server.Collaborate on system architecture design, applying object-oriented principles and design patterns.Contribute to code reviews and version control workflows to ensure quality and maintainability.Document software features and testing procedures for internal and client use.Participate in testing and troubleshooting of complex systems.Support field deployment and commissioning software solutions across diverse operational environments.Please Note: It is the responsibility of the selected intern to make their own housing arrangements during the internship.  Amentum can provide suggestions for housing options.Required Qualifications Currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering with a concentration in software development from an ABET-accredited institution.Strong foundation in software development fundamentals, including object-oriented design patterns, version control (e.g., Git), and software development lifecycle best practices.Ability to work collaboratively in a team environment to design, develop, and deliver software applications and data acquisition projects.US Citizenship (due to project requirements)Preferred QualificationsExperience with microcontrollers, home automation, or single board computers.Familiarity with data acquisition systems and tools from vendors such as National Instruments (NI), UEI DAQ, Dewesoft, Chell, or Ipetronik.Experience with programming languages such as LabVIEW, C#, and .NET.Experience with databases, cybersecurity, and data transport technologies such as MQTT, Redis, and Kafka       Compensation Details:$20.00 - $23.00       The compensation range or hourly rate listed for this position is provided as a good-faith estimate of what the company intends to offer for this role at the time this posting was issued.
