Together, we reached unicorn status in 2021, and we remain committed to continuing this high-growth trajectory with the right team to fulfill our mission: building the infrastructure layer for content intelligence. If you’re inspired to dream big, innovate fast, and make a difference, we’d love to hear from you! For more information, visit www.newsbreak.com/aboutWhat we do We build a consumer app with a strong focus on product quality and fast iteration. Small team, high ownership, real production impact Responsibilities Build and ship core app experiences end-to-end (screens, state, networking, navigation) Integrate with backend APIs to deliver key user flows (auth, feed, interactions, etc.) Improve performance and reliability: startup time, smooth scrolling, memory usage, crash-free sessions Work closely with product/design/engineering to iterate quickly and make strong trade-offs Help prototype and integrate AI-powered features (scope depends on the project) Requirements App development experience (required): React Native / Flutter / native iOS / native Android — able to ship production-grade screens and integrate APIs Strong fundamentals in software engineering: clean code, modularity, debugging, and Git-based collaboration Solid understanding of mobile/client fundamentals: network requests, caching, async programming, and performance profiling AI/ML knowledge (required): familiar with classic + modern model families and how they’re used in products (e.g., CNN/RNN/Transformer, LLMs, multimodal models). Can reason about capabilities, limitations, and practical integration patterns Strong communication and a “ship-it” mindset in ambiguous, fast-moving environments Preferred Qualifications Experience shipping a 0→1 mobile app or owning a feature end-to-end Familiarity with on-device ML concepts, model inference constraints, or edge optimization Experience with experimentation/metrics, analytics instrumentation, or A/B testing Backend exposure (APIs, databases, caching) is a plus but not required CPRA Privacy Notice for California Candidates",
