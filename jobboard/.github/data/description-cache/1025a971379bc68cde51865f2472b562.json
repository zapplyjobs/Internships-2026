    "description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About Vercel: Vercel is the platform for building and deploying the modern web. The Frontend Cloud provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web—trusted by teams at Under Armour, eBay, The Washington Post, Johnson & Johnson, and Zapier. Now, with the AI Cloud, Vercel extends this foundation to power agentic applications. The AI Cloud is a unified platform for AI workloads, combining AI SDK, AI Gateway, Fluid Compute, MCP server support, and secure sandboxes, giving teams everything they need to build conversational AI frontends and autonomous agents without infrastructure overhead. At Vercel, our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. We're here for the next era of the web, where developers don't just write apps, they define agents. About the role: We are looking for a Senior Solutions Engineer to join our Professional Services team. This is not a traditional consulting role—you will embed directly with our most strategic enterprise customers to drive transformational outcomes across frontend modernization, platform migrations, and AI adoption. In this role, you will lead complex Next.js migrations, architect high-performance applications, and build production AI solutions—all within customer environments. You'll work hands-on-keyboard alongside customer teams, whether you're migrating a legacy React application to App Router, conducting a deep-dive code audit, or deploying production agents using Vercel's AI SDK. You will be equally comfortable leading a technical discovery session with engineering leadership as you are refactoring a complex rendering strategy or optimizing an agentic workflow. Our Solutions Engineers operate with high agency and autonomy. You'll navigate ambiguous enterprise environments, assess technical debt, design migration strategies, and deliver measurable business value—all while building long-term relationships that expand our partnership with each customer. You will report to the Director of Professional Services and will be remote-first with significant travel (25-40%) to customer sites for embedded engagements. What you will do: Lead complex frontend migrations—modernizing legacy React, Vue, or other frameworks to Next.js, including Pages to App Router transitions, incremental adoption strategies, and large-scale codebase transformations. Conduct technical assessments and code audits, analyzing customer codebases for performance bottlenecks, architectural anti-patterns, and optimization opportunities—delivering actionable roadmaps that drive measurable improvements. Architect and implement high-performance Next.js applications, leveraging App Router, Server Components, streaming, ISR, edge functions, and advanced rendering strategies to meet enterprise scale and performance requirements. Optimize Core Web Vitals and application performance, using tools like Vercel Speed Insights to diagnose issues and implement fixes that improve SEO, conversion rates, and user experience. Build production AI solutions using Vercel's AI SDK and AI Cloud—including conversational interfaces, production agents, MCP servers, and agentic workflows that transform customer operations. Embed with strategic customers to build production applications—working within their systems, understanding their constraints, and shipping TypeScript code that goes live. Drive enablement and knowledge transfer through workshops, pair programming, and documentation—ensuring customer teams can extend and maintain solutions independently. Navigate complex enterprise environments by building relationships with stakeholders across engineering, product, and executive teams—translating technical capabilities into business outcomes. Participate in pre-sales activities by providing technical expertise during discovery calls, scoping sessions, and proposal development for migrations, audits, and AI transformation engagements. Contribute to our service evolution by identifying repeatable patterns, building reusable components, and sharing implementation insights back to Product and Engineering teams. About you: 5+ years of experience in software engineering with at least 2 years in a customer-facing technical role (consulting, solutions engineering, forward deployed engineering, or technical founder experience). Expert-level TypeScript skills—this is your primary language. You write production TypeScript daily and have strong opinions on type safety, patterns, and tooling. Deep expertise in Next.js, with a proven track record of architecting and delivering complex applications using App Router, Server Components, server-side rendering (SSR), static generation (SSG), incremental static regeneration (ISR), and edge functions. Demonstrated experience leading frontend migrations—you've modernized legacy applications to Next.js, navigated incremental adoption strategies, and understand the challenges of migrating large codebases in production environments. Mastery of React and its ecosystem, including advanced state management, performance optimization, and modern patterns like streaming, suspense, and concurrent features. Production experience with LLMs and AI applications, including prompt engineering, agent development, and tool use patterns. Familiarity with Vercel's AI SDK is strongly preferred. High agency with comfort in ambiguity—you thrive when given a problem to solve rather than a task to complete, and you can navigate complex organizations to drive outcomes. Exceptional communication skills with the ability to conduct technical discovery, present to executives, mentor engineers, and build lasting customer relationships—all with a low-ego, collaborative approach. Business acumen to understand customer objectives, translate technical capabilities into ROI, and identify expansion opportunities throughout engagement lifecycles. Willingness to travel 25-40% to customer sites for embedded work and relationship building. Bonus if you: Have led large-scale migrations from legacy frameworks (Create React App, Gatsby, custom webpack setups) to Next.js in enterprise environments. Have expertise in performance optimization and Core Web Vitals, with experience diagnosing and fixing LCP, CLS, and INP issues at scale. Have experience with Model Context Protocol (MCP), building MCP servers, or implementing complex tool-use patterns in production AI applications. Have led enterprise AI transformation initiatives, including building production agents that automated manual processes or replaced legacy systems. Have worked with micro-frontends, module federation, or multi-team frontend architectures. Have contributed to the Next.js, React, or AI SDK open-source projects, or maintain popular related libraries. Have experience with enterprise deployment patterns including security reviews, compliance requirements, and multi-region architectures. Have a background in financial services, healthcare, retail/e-commerce, or media—industries with complex frontend ecosystems and growing AI adoption. Have spoken at conferences or published thought leadership on frontend architecture, migrations, or AI applications. Benefits: Great compensation package and stock options. Inclusive Healthcare Package. Learn and Grow - we provide mentorship and send you to events that help you build your network and skills. Flexible Time Off - Flexible vacation policy with a recommended 4-weeks per year, and paid holidays. Remote Friendly - Work with teammates from different time zones across the globe.
