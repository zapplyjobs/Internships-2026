    "description": "About the teamThe team builds Agentic Retrieval systems that power intelligent search, retrieval, and reasoning across Zoom’s enterprise platforms. We work at the intersection of knowledge graphs, retrieval systems, large language models, and production engineering to enable scalable, reliable access to enterprise knowledge. Interns are treated as full contributors and work on real problems alongside experienced engineers and scientists.What you can expectAs a Machine Learning, Applied Scientist, or Research Engineer Intern, you will contribute to Enterprise Graph Retrieval within the Agentic Retrieval systems that support Zoom. You will work on building graph-based retrieval and reasoning capabilities that enhance enterprise RAG systems and enable intelligent AI agents. Your work will focus on designing, building, and evaluating graph-powered retrieval systems that operate on real enterprise data and directly impact users across Zoom products. You will collaborate closely with engineers and product partners, contribute to technical discussions, and deliver working components, evaluations, and demos that showcase graph-enhanced search and agentic reasoning.Responsibilities:Depending on project needs and individual strengths, you may work in one or more of the following areas:Design and model enterprise graph schemasDesign flexible graph schemas representing enterprise relationships, including:Document-to-document relationships such as references, versions, and derivativesMeeting-to-content relationships such as notes, presentations, and follow-upsUser-to-content relationships such as authorship, editing, and viewershipTopic-based relationships across enterprise contentProduce clear schema documentation and entity relationship modelsBuild graph construction pipelinesBuild data processing workflows to extract relationship signals from raw enterprise contentApply LLM-based extraction techniques combined with enterprise knowledge bases for entity resolutionTransform extracted signals into graph edges and propertiesLoad, update, and maintain graph data in a graph database such as Amazon NeptuneOptionally ensure consistency with enterprise access control and permission modelsImplement graph-aware querying and retrievalImplement graph-aware retrieval mechanismsTranslate natural language queries into graph queriesApply LLM-based query splitting and triplet extractionPerform schema-driven graph traversal, subgraph extraction, and multi-hop retrievalSupport contextual and relationship-based retrieval use casesIntegrate and evaluate retrieval systemsIntegrate graph-based retrieval signals into a unified enterprise retrieval pipelineDesign evaluation metrics to measure retrieval quality improvementsAnalyze relevance, latency, and scalability trade-offsBuild end-to-end demos showcasing graph-enhanced search and agentic reasoningWhat we're looking for:(Required)Currently pursuing a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, AI, or a related fieldDemonstrate strong programming skills in Python; Java is a plusApply solid foundations in algorithms, data structures, and system designShow interest in information retrieval, RAG systems, or knowledge-centric AIPreferred skills (Especially relevant for Applied Scientist / Research Engineer candidates)Graph & Knowledge RepresentationExperience with knowledge graphs, property graphs, or RDF-based systemsFamiliarity with graph query languages (Gremlin, SPARQL, Cypher, or similar)Understanding of graph modeling, schema design, and relationship semanticsExperience with graph databases (e.g., Amazon Neptune, Neo4j, JanusGraph)GraphRAG & RetrievalHands-on experience with GraphRAG or hybrid graph + vector retrieval systemsKnowledge of combining symbolic graph reasoning with neural retrievalExperience integrating graph signals into ranking or retrieval pipelinesFamiliarity with subgraph extraction, path-based reasoning, or multi-hop retrievalApplied ML / ResearchExperience using LLMs for:Information extractionEntity resolution / linkingQuery understanding or rewritingExposure to retrieval evaluation metrics (e.g., relevance, recall, task success)Ability to design experiments and analyze results for retrieval quality improvementsSystems & ScalingExperience building data pipelines for large-scale datasetsFamiliarity with cloud-native systems (AWS preferred)Understanding of performance, latency, and scalability trade-offs in retrieval systemsSalary Range or On Target Earnings:Minimum:$66.50Maximum:$106.50In addition to the base salary and/or OTE listed Zoom has a Total Direct Compensation philosophy that takes into consideration; base salary, bonus and equity value.Note: Starting pay will be based on a number of factors and commensurate with qualifications & experience.We also have a location based compensation structure;  there may be a different range for candidates in this and other locations.Ways of WorkingOur structured hybrid approach is centered around our offices and remote work environments.
