The selected intern is expected to report to the office up to three times per week or as determined by the team.  Locations: Sunnyvale, California  Mountain View, California  About the Team:  The Simulation group builds artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models that power realistic environments for testing and training advanced systems. These simulations generate diverse scenarios that help validate and improve decision-making policies across robotics, autonomous systems, and other AI-driven applications. Think of Simulation as a virtual training ground where complex systems learn to operate safely and effectively. The team develops AI/ML models that control simulated entities—whether vehicles, robots, or other agents—so they interact in realistic and dynamic ways. Our technology stack includes generative models, reinforcement learning (RL), and other ML approaches. The Simulation group collaborates closely with teams in behaviors, perception, safety engineering, and infrastructure to deliver scalable, high-fidelity environments. As an intern, you’ll gain hands-on experience in AI/ML model development, training loop optimization, and simulation infrastructure design, while learning from experienced engineers in the robotics and AI space.   What You’ll Do: Assist in developing ML and RL models, including training loop design and optimization. Help streamline integration and contribute to ML infrastructure, metrics, and data pipelines. Collaborate with the AI/ML team to support rapid experimentation and deployment in simulation environments. Apply software engineering skills to accelerate project timelines in areas such as robotics, autonomous systems, and simulation frameworks. Learn how simulation technologies are applied to real-world AI and ML systems. Participate in code reviews, technical discussions, and design resign Collaborate with cross-functional teams including hardware, systems, test, and safety to ensure seamless software integration Communicate effectively across multiple stakeholders  Required Qualifications: We’re looking for students who are eager to learn and contribute. What you need is curiosity, strong fundamentals, and a passion for AI and simulation. Currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, Electrical Engineering, or a related field. Familiarity with machine learning concepts and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Strong programming skills in Python or C++. Exposure to reinforcement learning, generative models, or GPU programming. Interest in simulation, robotics, or autonomous systems. Able to work fulltime, 40 hours per week.  Preferred Qualifications: Demonstrated software engineering experience from previous internships, work experience, coding competitions, or publications. Experience with projects involving ML pipelines, optimization, or robotics competitions. Intent to return to degree-program after the completion of the internship/co-op.  Compensation: The monthly salary range for this role is $12,300 per month  GM will provide a one-time lump sum taxable stipend payment to eligible students selected for the 2026 Student Program.  What you’ll get from us (Benefits): Paid US GM Holidays GM Family First Vehicle Discount Program Result-based potential for growth within GM Intern events to network with company leaders and peers  \n\nAbout GMOur vision is a world with Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions and Zero Congestion and we embrace the responsibility to lead the change that will make our world better, safer and more equitable for all.Why Join Us We believe we all must make a choice every day – individually and collectively – to drive meaningful change through our words, our deeds and our culture.
