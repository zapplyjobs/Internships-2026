Collaborate on complex and ambiguous problems, partnering with cross-functional teams to solve deep architectural puzzles and take existing systems closer to desired end states. Mentor and grow fellow engineers, fostering a culture of ownership and mentorship within a high-performing, self-organized team. Drive the product development process for platform capabilities, from influencing initial feature specs to maintaining code that powers core experiences. Improve the productivity of our product engineering culture by building tools and shared capabilities that allow teams to move faster. Continuously apply AI tools to accelerate development, using AI to build, test, and iterate quickly while staying curious about emerging frameworks and patterns. Here’s what we're looking for: 12+ years of relevant professional experience in software engineering. Able to build maintainable, structured, well-documented code, with specific proficiency in Ruby on Rails and a strong focus on architectural patterns. Strong knowledge of data structures, data modeling, and system design, particularly within complex, interconnected systems. Experience working across multiple teams, influencing both product and team direction by advocating for technical health and reusability. Experience working on platform products which are depended upon throughout the company, ideally involving service extraction or componentization. Experience engineering, designing, building, and supporting large-scale systems in production, ensuring high reliability and scalability. Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $189,000/yr to $237,000/yr in Denver & most remote locations, $223,000/yr to $279,000/yr for San Francisco, New York & Seattle and $200,000(CAD)/yr to $250,000(CAD)/yr in Canada.
