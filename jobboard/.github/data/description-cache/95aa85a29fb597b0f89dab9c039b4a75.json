    "description": "<div class=\"content-intro\"><p>Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with the mission to be the world's most trusted driver. Since its start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo’s fully autonomous ride-hail service and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over ten million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving over 100 million miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 15+ U.S. states.</p></div><p>The Waymo Simulation team builds state-of-the-art simulations of realistic environments for testing and training the Waymo Driver, which is Waymo's autonomous driving technology. They develop industry-leading simulation solutions using advanced machine learning algorithms to measure and enhance the performance of the Waymo Driver. Waymo interns work with leaders in the industry on projects that deliver significant impact to the company.
