    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role In this role on the Applied AI team, you will lead the delivery of transformational AI solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises. You'll own high-value engagements where we collaborate directly with customers to build tailored AI agents for their most critical business processes. You will own end-to-end delivery from signed SOW through production deployment, orchestrating cross-functional teams including Engineering, Product, Design, and customer stakeholders. This is not project management—you'll navigate complex enterprise environments, remove technical and organizational blockers, and ensure we deliver measurable business outcomes while maintaining our high standards for safety and reliability. You'll work hand-in-hand with Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) who handle core technical delivery, while you own stakeholder management, delivery cadence, and organizational complexity. You'll champion our mission in the field while building the playbooks and processes that enable us to scale this emerging motion. Responsibilities: Draft Statements of Work (SOWs) alongside engineers, structuring engagements with clear scope, milestones, and success criteria. Participate in technical discovery sessions to understand customer requirements and inform engagement design. Own AI product building end-to-end: maintain and adjust roadmaps as scope evolves, identify and work through blockers, and help the team navigate delivery challenges. Drive engagement delivery from SOW signature through production deployment, ensuring milestones are met, blockers are removed, and stakeholders are aligned. Partner closely with FDEs: manage organizational complexity and facilitate their access to customer stakeholders and systems. Orchestrate cross-functional teams: coordinate Engineering, Product/Design resources, and customer teams to deliver integrated solutions on time and within scope. Manage stakeholder relationships: maintain regular cadence with customer executive sponsors, technical leads, and procurement while surfacing issues and celebrating wins. Lead delivery operations: run sprint ceremonies, milestone reviews, and progress reporting; translate technical complexity into executive-level updates. Navigate enterprise complexity: work through security reviews, legal approvals, procurement processes, and organizational dynamics that can block progress. Manage scope and change: handle scope changes, set expectations, and negotiate contract modifications when needed. Identify risks early and develop mitigation strategies; know when to escalate to leadership and provide clear context when doing so. Serve as the first line of escalation for FDEs and customer stakeholders; resolve conflicts before they impact delivery. Document engagement patterns, create repeatable frameworks, and contribute to the operational infrastructure that enables growth. Travel as needed to customer sites to build relationships, unblock issues, and demonstrate Anthropic's commitment (25-50% travel expected). You May Be a Good Fit If You Have: 5+ years of experience in technical program management, engagement management, or delivery leadership in professional services, consulting, or enterprise software. Track record delivering complex technical projects for Fortune 500 clients, ideally large-scale engagements with multiple workstreams. Strong technical acumen with ability to understand AI/ML concepts, software architecture, and enterprise systems (you don't need to code, but must be able to translate between technical and business stakeholders). Executive presence with ability to present to C-suite sponsors and navigate enterprise organizational dynamics. High agency with demonstrated ability to remove blockers, make decisions with incomplete information, and drive progress through ambiguity. Exceptional communication skills for managing diverse stakeholders, running effective meetings, and producing clear status reporting. Process design mindset with ability to create structure where none exists while remaining flexible to emerging patterns. High cooperation orientation for balancing competing priorities across customer needs, engineering capacity, and product strategy. Strong Plus: Experience in financial services, healthcare/life sciences, or pharma verticals. Background at a Forward Deployed Engineering company or Big 3 / Big 4 professional services and consulting firms. Exceptional understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations. Experience with regulated industries and compliance requirements. Experience managing delivery teams with embedded engineers at customer sites. Familiarity with agile/scrum methodologies in client-facing delivery contexts. The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$200,000 - $300,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
