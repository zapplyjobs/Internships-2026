    "description": "Archer is an aerospace company based in San Jose, California building an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with a mission to advance the benefits of sustainable air mobility. We are designing, manufacturing, and operating an all-electric aircraft that can carry four passengers while producing minimal noise. Our sights are set high and our problems are hard, and we believe that diversity in the workplace is what makes us smarter, drives better insights, and will ultimately lift us all to success. We are dedicated to cultivating an equitable and inclusive environment that embraces our differences, and supports and celebrates all of our team members.This internship is a part of a 10-week full-time summer internship program opportunity. This role will be based at Archer’s headquarters in San Jose, California and relocation or housing will not be provided. Join a world-class AI team dedicated to transforming the future of aviation through cutting-edge research and development. What You’ll Do: Develop and iterate on reinforcement learning algorithms within high-fidelity simulation environments. Engineer reward functions, state-action spaces, and input representations for simulation-based learned policies. Build and refine machine learning models for the processing and interpretation of complex communication streams and telemetry data. Architect solutions for sequence-to-sequence transcription, natural language reasoning, and the extraction of intent from multi-modal data sources. Collaborate with research engineers to configure and optimize simulation setups, ensuring they accurately reflect physical constraints for data generation. Partner with research engineers to prototype solutions from academic literature that address specialized domain vocabularies and high-stakes operational contexts. Prototype and validate promising techniques from academic literature to benchmark model behavior and robustness. Build scripts and tools to support reproducible experimentation and streamlined data collection. Run experiments to benchmark model accuracy and reasoning capabilities across diverse datasets and edge-case scenarios. Communicate progress and research findings to the team in a concise manner while staying current with latest developments. What You Need: Pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Robotics, Engineering, Data Science, or a related technical field. Proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch), or modern NLP libraries (Hugging Face, Transformers). Experience with reinforcement learning and physics-based simulation engines. Ability to translate mathematical concepts from research papers into functional code. Familiarity with sequence-to-sequence modeling, speech recognition, or multi-modal AI. Analytical skills with experience handling large-scale or unstructured datasets.
