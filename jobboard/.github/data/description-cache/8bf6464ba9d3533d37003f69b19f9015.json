This is a cutting‑edge role for someone excited by AI who wants to help shape how it is applied across a large enterprise—not as experimentation, but as a practical driver of productivity and better ways of working.</p><p>In this role, you’ll operate much like a<span> </span><b>business‑facing AI solution architect</b>. You’ll partner with teams across the company to understand how their work actually gets done, identify broken or inefficient processes, and help determine where AI—such as Microsoft Copilot or AI agents—can meaningfully improve outcomes. From there, you’ll help turn those ideas into reality by supporting the thoughtful implementation, adoption, and scaling of AI‑enabled solutions.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, you’ll contribute to the<span> </span><b>middle‑out engine</b><span> </span>that makes AI adoption stick: building community, learning from real wins, and spreading what works so teams can learn from one another.
