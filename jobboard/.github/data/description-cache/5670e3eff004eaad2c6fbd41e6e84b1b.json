    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're looking for a Recruiting Systems Analyst to build the integrations and automations that power our recruiting function at scale. You'll work at the intersection of recruiting operations, AI application, and systems engineering—building API integrations, automating workflows across the candidate lifecycle, and ensuring data flows correctly between systems. We're looking for someone who can see a manual process, understand the recruiting context behind it, and ship a working solution. The ideal candidate has experience working within the recruiting or people function and picked up technical skills along the way—or has deep integration experience and genuine curiosity about how talent acquisition actually works. Either way, you understand that the best automation respects the human moments in recruiting while eliminating the tedious ones. What You'll Do Build and maintain integrations between recruiting tools (Greenhouse, Gem, ModernLoop, BrightHire) using APIs, webhooks, and automation platforms like Tines Automate manual workflows across the candidate lifecycle—from sourcing to offer to onboarding handoffs Partner with Recruiting Operations to identify high-impact automation opportunities and translate them into technical solutions Own the full lifecycle from discovery through deployment: scoping requirements with recruiting users, building prototypes, gathering feedback, and iterating to production Troubleshoot and resolve integration issues, ensuring data flows correctly between systems Create documentation and lightweight enablement resources so the team can maintain and extend your work Collaborate with internal engineering departments on shared infrastructure while owning the \"middle layer\" of recruiting-specific automations You May Be a Good Fit If You: Have 5+ years of experience in recruiting operations, talent systems, HR technology, or a similar function—you understand recruiting workflows and why they exist Have hands-on experience building automations and integrations using platforms like Tines, Workato, Zapier, or similar tools Are comfortable working with APIs, webhooks—you can read API documentation and build working integrations independently Have used scripting languages (Python, JavaScript) to solve problems, even if you're not a software engineer by training Excel at translating business problems into technical solutions—you ask the right questions to understand what recruiters actually need Have a track record of building trust with non-technical stakeholders and shipping products they actually use Are willing to do the unglamorous work: sometimes the right solution is a well-built spreadsheet, sometimes it's a complex multi-system integration Are excited about AI's potential to transform knowledge work and care about building systems that are safe and beneficial Strong Candidates May Also Have: Experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and AI application development Experience administering Greenhouse at a configuration and API level Familiarity with Workday integrations and HRIS data flows Experience with data analysis, reporting tools, or building dashboards Understanding of compliance considerations in recruiting (EEOC, GDPR, etc.) Our Current Tech Stack Greenhouse (ATS) Gem (sourcing & CRM) ModernLoop (scheduling) BrightHire (interview intelligence) Tines (automation) Workday (HRIS) JIRA (ticketing) Outline (documentation) Google Workspace Slack The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$170,000 - $220,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
