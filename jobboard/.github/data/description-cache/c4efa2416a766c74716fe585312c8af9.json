    "description": "About Us We are Sila, a next-generation battery materials company. Our mission is to power the world’s transition to clean energy. To create this future, our team is building a better lithium-ion battery from the inside out today. We engineer and manufacture ground-breaking battery materials that significantly increase the energy density of batteries, while reducing their size and weight. The result? Smaller more powerful batteries that can unlock innovation in consumer devices and accelerate the mass adoption of electric cars to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels. We're tackling one of the biggest challenges of our time every day, and together we're redefining what's possible. Are you ready to be a part of a team committed to changing the world?Who You Are Are you a thoughtful, creative, and code-savvy simulation scientist or engineer? We are looking for someone who sits at the intersection of computer science and electrochemistry. You might be a software engineer with a passion for physics, or a theorist with a talent for building robust software infrastructure. Sila Nanotechnologies is seeking a Battery Simulation & Computational Scientist (Intern) to: Architect and implement physics-based battery models using PyBaMM. Bridge the gap between theoretical equations and production-grade software code. Leverage key insights from our battery models to accelerate learning cycles and reduce the cost of empirical R&D. Responsibilities and Duties Commit to a 6+ month internship (Remote or Onsite); this is not a position for students only available for summer months. Analyze electrochemical data to build, parameterize, and apply new numerical models. Fit electrochemical models to experimental data and evaluate model performance across a range of different electrochemical test techniques. Support infrastructure development, helping to build the backend pipelines and tools that bring physics-based models to a wider audience. Work closely with scientists and cross-functional teams to discover and communicate knowledge for the long-term development of our next-generation battery materials. Invest in our values and champion them as we grow. Knowledge and Skill Requirements BSc (or preferably MSc/currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program) or equivalent research experience in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Chemical Engineering, Materials Science, or a related field. Strong experience using PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling) is required. Mastery of Python, including standard scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas). Experience interacting with databases using SQL or Snowflake. Proficient with Git and collaboration platforms (GitHub or GitLab). Ability to navigate and execute workflows in Linux or macOS terminal environments. Knowledge of electrochemical theory and the application of the P2D (Pseudo-Two-Dimensional) or Doyle-Fuller-Newman models. Public contributions to the PyBaMM repository or related sister projects on GitHub. Proficiency in using AI coding tools (e.g., Claude Code, Copilot) and knowledge of effective prompting techniques to accelerate development. Experience building CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), or some exposure to full-stack development. Physical Demands and Working Conditions Move long distances (such as from building to building) and be stationary for extended periods of time Operate a computer and other office equipment, such as a laptop, copier/printer, etc in a fixed location This role is open to Remote candidates. The starting base pay for this role is between $25/hr and $39/hr at the time of posting. The actual base pay depends on many factors, such as education, experience, and skills. Base pay is only one part of Sila’s competitive Total Rewards package that can include benefits, perks, and equity. The base pay range is subject to change and may be modified in the future. This role may also be eligible for overtime.Working at Sila We believe that building a diverse team at Sila helps us amplify our individual talents. We are an equal opportunity employer and committed to creating an inclusive environment where good ideas are free to come from anyone. We are proud to celebrate diversity and all qualified applicants are considered for employment without regard to gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, national origin, or any other status protected by law.",
