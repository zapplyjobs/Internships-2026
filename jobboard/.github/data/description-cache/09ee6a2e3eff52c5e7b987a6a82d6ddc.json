Salary Region 2: 60 USDJob DescriptionPrimary Function of Position We are seeking a self-motivated intern to support our AI Research and Development team in projects focused on developing a variety of AI foundation models based on multi-modal surgical data. This unique role focuses on the application of cutting-edge Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models and advanced robot learning techniques to enhance the capabilities of the da Vinci surgical system. The ideal candidate will bridge the gap between large-scale multimodal AI research and practical, high-impact applications in a safety-critical medical domain.Essential Job Duties Conduct research and development on AI technology for surgical robotics, specifically integrating visual data (endoscopic video), surgical context (language/data), and precise robotic actions (instrument control).Develop and implement novel algorithms for VLA models focused on surgical scene understanding, procedure phase recognition, and learning from expert demonstrations (e.g., imitation learning) to improve system guidance and automation features.Analyze and process large, real-world surgical datasets from the da Vinci system to train and evaluate AI models.Validate models using both internal simulation platforms and, where appropriate, physical da Vinci systems, adhering to strict quality and regulatory protocols.Collaborate with a cross-functional team of engineers, researchers, and potentially even clinicians/surgeons, to translate research prototypes into robust, testable software solutions.Document research outcomes and contribute to technical reports and internal documentation, with potential opportunities for patent filings or conference submissions. QualificationsRequired Skills and Experience University Hiring Program Eligibility Requirements:University Enrollment: Must be currently enrolled in and returning to an accredited degree-seeking academic program in the Fall.Internship Work Period: Must be available to work starting January 2026 and full-time (approximately 40 hours per week) during a 10-12 week period.

For any Intuitive role subject to export controls, final offers are contingent upon obtaining an approved export license and/or an executed TCP prior to the prospective employee’s start date, which may or may not be flexible, and within a timeframe that does not unreasonably impede the hiring need. If applicable, candidates will be notified and instructed on any requirements for these purposes. We will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records in accordance with fair chance laws.We provide market-competitive compensation packages, inclusive of base pay (paid at an hourly rate), benefits, and a housing allowance. It would not be typical for someone to be hired at the top end of range for the role, as actual pay will be determined based on several factors, including relevant skills and experience for this internship, degree-seeking academic program (PhD, Master’s, Bachelor’s, etc), year in school, and location. The hourly rate is prorated against the intern program salaries listed and total program compensation will be based on internship duration.I'm interestedI'm interestedPrivacy Policy",
