    "description": "About InterDigitalInterDigital is a global research and development company focused primarily on wireless, video, artificial intelligence (“AI”), and related technologies. We design and develop foundational technologies that enable connected, immersive experiences in a broad range of communications and entertainment products and services. We license our innovations worldwide to companies providing such products and services, including makers of wireless communications devices, consumer electronics, IoT devices, cars and other motor vehicles, and providers of cloud-based services such as video streaming. As a leader in wireless technology, our engineers have designed and developed a wide range of innovations that are used in wireless products and networks, from the earliest digital cellular systems to 5G and today’s most advanced Wi-Fi technologies. We are also a leader in video processing and video encoding/decoding technology, with a significant AI research effort that intersects with both wireless and video technologies. Founded in 1972, InterDigital is listed on Nasdaq.InterDigital is a registered trademark of InterDigital, Inc. For more information, visit: www.interdigital.com.Job SummaryThe InterDigital AI Lab is seeking motivated Ph.D. and Master students for internships in Deep Learning for Image and Video Processing.The Lab’s research focuses on novel applications of AI and machine learning for video and wireless applications. Unlike traditional roles that involve tinkering with obscure parts of ads or social networks, you’ll have the opportunity to develop proof-of-concepts, prototypes, and research ideas that integrate machine learning and AI technologies with a wide range of video and wireless technologies. Your work will have the chance to be published at leading conferences.Our recent work focuses on distributed, real-time computer vision for edge-cloud systems. We reduce bandwidth usage by compressing intermediate feature maps using a practical mix of learned methods and standard video codecs (e.g., H.264). We mitigate network latency with Dedelayed, a delay-aware split inference technique recently submitted to ICLR. We also created the leading open-source library for deep learning-based image and video compression (github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI), and an open-source platform used by MPEG to benchmark video coding for distributed vision models (github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI-Vision).Come intern with us if you are interested in one of the following research areas:Data compression:Deep learning-based image and video compression.Deep learning-based image and video restoration.Compression for multiple computer vision tasks.Compression of intermediate feature maps for split inference.Compression of tokens and embeddings in ViTs and VLMs.Compression enhanced by language embeddings as side information.Differentiable proxy/surrogate of video codecs; variable-rate control; error resilience.Real-time distributed inference:Distributed real-time video inference resilient to wireless latency, jitter, and bandwidth limits.Vision tasks: semantic segmentation, depth estimation, object detection, future-frame prediction, super-resolution.Motion modelling and prediction for latency mitigation in dynamic scenes.Inference that adapts to fluctuating network, compute, and power constraints.Low-power mobile device models assisted by powerful cloud models in real-time.Applications: autonomous driving, delivery drones, robotics.Efficient model inference.And:Visually realistic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).Unique or novel ideas. Qualifications:Ph.D. student in Computer Science/Engineering preferred, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or relevant discipline.Strong background in at least one of computer vision, image processing, or video compression.Proficient in PyTorch (preferred), TensorFlow, or JAX.Internship Benefits:We promote long-lasting collaborations with our interns.Publish in leading conferences including CVPR, ICLR, ICCV, ICASSP, ICIP, DCC, PCS.Opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers in their fields.InterDigital leads the way in Video and Wireless Technologies:Laser focused on research with more than 300 engineers and researchers.We invent solutions for efficient wireless networks, better video delivery, and richer multimedia experiences – more than $1B invested in R&D efforts since 2000.We designed and developed a wide range of technologies used in 4G and 5G wireless, and in many video standards (MPEG, H.265, H.266, …).80% of consumer electronics manufacturers integrate our technology.Internship: Full Time (Resident) onsiteLocation: Los Altos, CAInterDigital is an equal employment opportunity employer.
