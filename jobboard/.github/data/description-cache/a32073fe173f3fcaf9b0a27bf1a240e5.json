We strive to create, champion and maintain a global workplace where individuals’ unique contributions are valued and drive innovative solutions to meet the needs of our patients, care partners, families and employees.Our people are compassionate, candid, and purposeful, and our business is innovative and rooted in science. We believe that being proudly authentic and determined to be our best is essential to fulfilling our purpose. Yes, our work is incredibly serious and impactful, but we have big ambitions, bring a ton of care to pursuing them, and have a lot of fun while doing so.Does this inspire you and feel like a fit? Then we would love to have you join us!Job TitleAI-Driven Radiomics and Multimodal Biomarker Discovery InternWhy GenmabOur internship program provides interns with hands-on experience and relevant projects that directly align with our company’s goals.  Additionally, we believe our program provides a valuable opportunity to learn, thrive, and build a strong network.  We encourage you to review our website to learn why we’re always looking for smart, purpose-led candidates to play a role in our bold, extra[not]ordinary® future.Job OverviewAs an AI-Driven Radiomics and Multimodal Biomarker Discovery Intern, you will join Genmab’s Translational Data Science team for a 10-week summer internship. You’ll work at the forefront of AI and computational oncology, developing next-generation deep learning frameworks that integrate radiomic features from clinical imaging with molecular and genomic profiles. Radiomics transforms medical imaging data (CT, MRI, PET) into high-dimensional quantitative descriptors capturing tumor morphology, texture, and spatial heterogeneity. Integrating these features with genomic and molecular datasets provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify multiscale biomarkers predictive of therapeutic outcomes. This internship will leverage both public datasets (e.g., TCGA-LUAD/LUSC, NLST) and commercial imaging and molecular resources, providing a rich landscape for developing generalizable multimodal models. You’ll apply CNNs, transformers, and self-supervised learning to bridge imaging and molecular data for biomarker discovery.What You’ll Do This project aims to uncover novel, clinically actionable biomarkers to advance precision oncology. You’ll contribute to the design, implementation, and validation of multimodal AI architectures that generate new insights into tumor biology, treatment response, and patient stratification.Deep Learning Architecture Development: Design, train, and optimize advanced CNN-based and hybrid architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs, Vision Transformers, CNN -Transformer hybrids) to extract biologically meaningful radiomic representations.Multimodal Data Integration: Develop deep fusion models that combine imaging, molecular, and clinical data through cross-attention, late fusion, or graph-based techniques to enhance biomarker prediction and interpretability.Software Engineering & Reproducibility: Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following modern software engineering best practices.Feature Interpretation & Biomarker Discovery: Correlate learned features with genetic mutations (e.g., KRAS, EGFR, TP53), immune profiles, and clinical outcomes to identify interpretable and actionable biomarkers.Model Validation & Generalization: Conduct rigorous cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, and external dataset validation to assess model robustness and reproducibility.Collaboration & Communication: Work closely with computational biologists, bioinformaticians, and clinicians. Present progress and findings in internal seminars and contribute to internal reports and potential publications.Required Qualifications, Capabilities and Skills:Currently pursuing a PhD or advanced Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Biomedical Engineering, Computational Biology, or a related quantitative discipline.Proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.Demonstrated experience developing CNNs, transformers, or multimodal architectures for medical imaging, omics, or related AI applications.Experience with data management and distributed training frameworks (e.g., Weights & Biases).Familiarity with radiomics extraction libraries (e.g., PyRadiomics, MONAI).Knowledge of model interpretability tools (Grad-CAM, SHAP, feature attribution) and evaluation metrics for biomedical data.Soft Skills: Analytical mindset, collaborative spirit, strong organizational skills, and proactive attitude.Preferred Qualifications, Capabilities and Skills:Strong understanding of or interest in cancer biologyGeneral Intern Information – Date/Location/ScheduleInternships will take place June – August 2026.  This role will be based in Princeton, NJ and operate on a required hybrid schedule – 3 days in the office and 2 days remote per week.
