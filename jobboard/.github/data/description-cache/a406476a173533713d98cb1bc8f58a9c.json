Operating at an unprecedented scale - processing trillions of data points per day - we empower seamless collaboration and problem-solving for tens of thousands of companies globally. Our engineering culture thrives on pragmatism, honesty, and simplicity, tackling complex challenges the right way. SDLC ObservabilityDatadog's Software Delivery Platform starts with a comprehensive, end-to-end visibility across the entire SDLC, helping customers catch issues before production, optimize costs, and accelerate delivery. Our product suite includes granular insights into CI/CD pipelines, intelligent test management and optimization, code quality gates, and automated DORA metrics across every major CI provider. This is more than monitoring; it's about preventing failures, removing bottlenecks and eliminating developer disruptions at scale.Runtime, Machine learning and CuriosityThis role requires a continued curiosity to explore uncharted spaces while innovating in more established ones. With the rise of AI-generated code, the volume of Pull Requests, CI runs, and Tests is growing fast, creating more noise, higher costs, and new bottlenecks for engineering teams.We’re tackling the impact of that growth on SDLC by absorbing and root-cause fixing CI instability, and generating/updating/orchestrating thousands of tests using production signals and quantifying how AI impacts SDLC. We have an appetite to solve hard problems in clever ways. Our users trust us with their observability data and we work hard to put it to good use for them.
