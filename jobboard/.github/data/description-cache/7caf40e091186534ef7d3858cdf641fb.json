    "description": "Lab Summary: Samsung Research America Digital Health Algorithms Team (https://www.sra.samsung.com/digital-health/) collaborates with top universities, hospitals, and healthcare-industry partners to collect large-scale data and develop novel AI/ML algorithms to transform how healthcare is delivered. We use design thinking to address some of healthcare’s toughest challenges, from improving care and producing better outcomes, to reducing costs and expanding access. Focusing on wearable, mobile, and cloud-based form factors, our multi-disciplinary team develops innovative technologies that we then turn into groundbreaking commercial products to support clinicians, patients, and consumers. We use advanced sensor technology to capture physiologic responses and make use of our AI/ML framework to build algorithms for developing digital biomarkers and digital interventions. We employ data analytics to supplement clinical care and facilitate remote patient monitoring, thereby helping patients make behavioral changes that improve their health and daily lives. Our work has been internationally recognized with 70+ peer-reviewed publications and 10 design awards. Our portfolio of digital health algorithmic solutions are important tools in helping clinicians and their patients monitor and manage serious health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer; as wells chronic illnesses including mental health, diabetes, hypertension, depression, sleep disorders, and obesity. Our work encompasses the entire range of processes, from ideating, developing, and incubating; to designing and delivering market-ready products; to supporting and evolving currently released products.
