    "description": "Energy & Materials Intern - Experimental Electrolyzer ModelingLos Altos, CAEnergy & Materials – Internships - Summer 2026 /Intern /HybridApply for this jobAt Toyota Research Institute (TRI), we’re on a mission to improve the quality of human life. We’re developing new tools and capabilities to amplify the human experience. To lead this transformative shift in mobility, we’ve built a world-class team advancing the state of the art in AI, robotics, driving, and material sciences.The TeamThe long-term vision of TRI’s Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery (AMDD) program is to accelerate the development of truly emissions-free mobility. Realizing this vision will require the discovery of new materials and devices for batteries, fuel cells, and more. Our aim at TRI is to merge sophisticated computational materials modeling, new experimental data, artificial intelligence, and automation to significantly accelerate materials research in this area. Our focus is on developing tools and capabilities to enable this acceleration. We collaborate closely with a dozen universities and national labs and our colleagues across global Toyota. AMDD seeks to develop and translate the newest technologies into practice, both within Toyota and the open research community, more broadly.The InternshipWe are looking for an intern researcher to contribute to the development of our physics-based water electrolyzer model. Together, we will develop materials-informed water electrolyzer models that provide insight into the design and testing of zero-gap electrolyzers, or related devices. Your day-to-day may include: data analytics for electrolyzers or half-cell data; mass transport, kinetic, and thermodynamic modeling; and/or structural causal model development. We welcome you to join a unique team of scientists and engineers where you will constantly learn new skills at the interface of materials science and AI.This is a Summer 2026 paid 12-week internship opportunity. Please note that this internship will be an in-office role.ResponsibilitiesResearch the latest advancements in the modeling of electrolyzers and related phenomena.Work with cross-functional teams of internal and external research collaborators across electrochemistry and ML/AI.Assist with building tools and capabilities that bridge physics-based modeling, experimental data, machine learning, and/or simulation.Act with humility, respect, and a collaborative spirit.QualificationsAre currently enrolled in a doctoral program in STEM subjects (chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or a related discipline).Hands-on experimental experience with zero-gap water electrolyzers.Experience with standard material characterization techniques (x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, etc.).Published manuscripts in the electrolysis field.Bonus QualificationsProficiency in PythonPlease add a link to Google Scholar to include a full list of publications when submitting your CV for this position.The pay range for this position at commencement of employment is expected to be between $45 and $65/hour for California-based roles. Base pay offered will depend on multiple individualized factors, including, but not limited to, business or organizational needs, market location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. TRI offers a generous benefits package including medical, dental, and vision insurance, and paid time off benefits (including holiday pay and sick time). Additional details regarding these benefit plans will be provided if an employee receives an offer of employment.Please reference this Candidate Privacy Notice to inform you of the categories of personal information that we collect from individuals who inquire about and/or apply to work for Toyota Research Institute, Inc. or its subsidiaries, including Toyota A.I.
