You’ll showcase your passion for customer support by resolving tax notices while delivering a world-class customer experience. You'll act as a detective and problem-solver discovering payroll discrepancies, researching tax laws, and identifying the root cause of notices. You will be working closely with tax agencies as well as our cross-functional partner teams to reach the best outcomes for our customers and provide feedback on tools that streamline the resolution process and prevent similar issues in the future. This role is very hands-on, with an emphasis on research and analysis, excellent communication skills, and first-principles problem-solving. A strong work ethic and desire to be part of the team is critical for success, as well as the ability to retain and apply large amounts of critical information. You must also possess and take pride in high attention to detail, organization, and task management, and be comfortable working in a fast-paced, deadline-driven business environment.

Manage your time effectively to meet set goals. Handle a queue of tax notices daily, including updating cases as needed, informing customers of any changes, and seeking assistance from peers on escalated issues. Participate in team meetings and provide support to fellow TaxRes Advocates. Here’s what we're looking for: 2-4 years of payroll experience, notice resolution experience is a plus. Ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams. Capability to manage multiple priorities within a high-volume, fast-paced environment and adapt to shifting priorities daily. Commitment to personal high standards and a desire to contribute to team and company goals. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with guidance to resolve issues from complex variables.
