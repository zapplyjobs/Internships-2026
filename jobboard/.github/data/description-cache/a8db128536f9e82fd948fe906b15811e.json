In this role, you will lead end‑to‑end development of LLM- and Agent‑based features that can:Debug and investigate application performance issues down to the root cause, as both a developer assistant and a fully autonomous agentProactively recommend performance and reliability-based optimizations to prevent the next incidentAutomatically create intelligent monitors and SLOs for the most important business flows and critical pathsThis is a highly product‑minded engineering role: you’ll work from problem discovery and UX all the way to reliable, scalable production systems.What you’ll doShape AI experiences for APM. Design and ship LLM/agentic workflows that analyze traces, metrics, logs, and other telemetry to generate diagnoses, explanations, and guided fixes.Own the full loop. Prototype quickly, define success metrics and evals, run experiments, iterate, and ultimately productionize for scale and reliability.Build robust agent systems. Develop tools, retrieval and planning strategies, and guardrails; manage prompts/evals; design fallbacks and human‑in‑the‑loop paths.Integrate with Datadog’s platform. Leverage surfaces like Trace Explorer, Service Catalog, monitors, and workflows to deliver end‑to‑end value in the APM UI.Partner deeply.
