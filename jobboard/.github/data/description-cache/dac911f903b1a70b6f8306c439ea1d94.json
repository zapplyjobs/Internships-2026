This role will contribute directly to safeguarding Gusto's financial health and ensuring compliance in a fast-paced fintech environment. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Lead the identification, assessment, and monitoring of financial risks across Gusto's operations, with an emphasis on revenue recognition, payment processing, treasury, and financial reporting.

Collaborate with the Head of Platform Controls and other stakeholders to integrate financial risk considerations into the design and effectiveness of internal controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR). Perform deep-dive analysis on potential financial exposures, including operational, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and propose mitigation strategies. Perform operational audits to identify organizational efficiencies and accelerate workflows. Support accounting, finance, and business partners in optimizing and implementing robust Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR), focusing on control automation, system configurations, data integrity, and integration within financial and operational systems. Prepare and present regular reports on financial risk posture, emerging risks, and mitigation efforts to executive management and relevant committees. Stay abreast of industry best practices, regulatory changes (e.g., US GAAP, COSO, PCAOB Auditing Standards), and emerging threats relevant to financial risk management in the fintech space. Here’s what we're looking for: 7+ years of progressive experience in financial risk management, internal audit, or SOX compliance, ideally within a fintech, payments, or high-growth technology company. Demonstrated experience in identifying, assessing, and mitigating financial risks across complex business processes and proprietary systems. Strong understanding of financial accounting principles (US GAAP), internal control frameworks (COSO), and risk management methodologies. Proven ability to analyze large volumes of financial and operational data to identify trends, anomalies, and potential risks. Excellent project management skills with a track record of leading cross-functional initiatives. Exceptional communication, presentation, and interpersonal skills, with the ability to articulate complex financial risks to both technical and non-technical audiences, including executive management. Bachelor’s degree in Accounting, Finance, Risk Management, or a related field; relevant professional certifications (e.g., FRM, CPA, CFA, CIA) are a plus. Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $132,000-$156,000/year in San Francisco & New York City, and $109,000- $129,000/year in Denver. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors, including candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City.
