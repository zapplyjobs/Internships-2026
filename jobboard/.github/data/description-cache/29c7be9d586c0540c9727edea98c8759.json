    "description": "2026 Summer Intern - Quantitative Systems PharmacologyDepartment SummaryThis intern position is in the Translational Pharmacokinetics (PK) & Pharmacodynamics (PD) or tPKPD Department within Development Sciences. The tPKPD department applies preclinical models (in silico, in vitro or in vivo) to determine the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) and/or pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) of biotherapeutics. The information obtained from such work is often used to help select lead molecules, optimize dosing regimens and understand the PK behavior/metabolic fate of different molecular designs as we help advance molecules through stages of research and into early clinical development. The work within the tPKPD department spans across a wide range of disease areas, including oncology, immunology, ophthalmology, infectious disease and neuroscience. This internship position is located in South San Francisco, on-site.  The OpportunityConduct systematic literature review to quantify the effects of liquid malignancies on bone marrow hematopoiesis and collate necessary PK and clinical cytopenia time-course data.Expand the existing hematopoietic toxicity QSP model to incorporate disease-specific mechanisms.Calibrate and validate the expanded model using a combination of internal data and curated literature data for relevant drugs.Develop proficiency in MATLAB/Simbiology.Prepare a final presentation summarizing the project methodology and findings.Program HighlightsIntensive 12-weeks, full-time (40 hours per week) paid internship.Program start dates are in May/June 2026.A stipend, based on location, will be provided to help alleviate costs associated with the internship. Ownership of challenging and impactful business-critical projects.Work with some of the most talented people in the biotechnology industry.Who You Are (Required) Required Education: You meet one of the following criteria:Must be pursuing a Master's Degree (enrolled student).Must be pursuing a PhD (enrolled student).Required Majors: Biomedical Engineering, Applied Math, Computer Science or other Pharmaceutical Sciences fields.Required Skills:2+ years of hands-on experience with MatLab and/or other modeling platform (R, Python, etc.).Strong interpersonal and oral/written communication skills with high attention to detail.Status: Applicants must be currently enrolled in an academic program.Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and QualificationsExcellent communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills.Complements our culture and the standards that guide our daily behavior & decisions: Integrity, Courage, and Passion.Experience with computational modeling of biological systems.Experience with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics principles and/or quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP).Some experience in MatLab Simbiology is a plus.Relocation benefits are not available for this job posting.  The expected salary range for this position based on the primary location of California is $50.00 hour.
