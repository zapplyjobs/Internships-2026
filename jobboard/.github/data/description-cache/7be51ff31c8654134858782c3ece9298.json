    "description": "About Clerk Clerk is on a mission to solve user management once and for all. We are a globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like &lt;SignUp/&gt; , &lt;SignIn/&gt; , &lt;UserProfile/&gt; , useUser , and useOrganization . These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs . What you’ll do As a Growth Engineer, you’ll help developers succeed faster with Clerk by shipping measurable improvements across our growth surfaces—SDK, docs/quickstart, dashboard onboarding, backend, and email. You’ll move quickly and learn in public with a team that cares about craft and outcomes. We will expect you to: Ship experiments across any surface (Clerk SDKs, docs/quickstart, dashboard, backend, email/CRM). Collaborate across engineering, design, product, and marketing to improve developer’s experiences using Clerk. Operate across the full stack: Next.js + JavaScript/TypeScript (including our JS SDK), Go services backed by Postgres; BigQuery and PostHog for analysis and flags. Establish clear hypothesis and success metrics for every experiment; instrument, launch behind flags, monitor, and share read-outs. Who you are Five+ years hands-on software engineering. 1–2+ years running growth experiments in PLG/SaaS (dev tools experience is ideal). Full-stack fluency with professional experience in JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js) and Go , plus strong SQL . Confident with your data. You can define events, query BigQuery , and analyze in PostHog and Hex (or something similar). You ship unblocked, communicate clearly, and close the loop. You’re driven to understand the “why” behind everything and can focus that intense curiosity into action. You’re user-focused and all about open collaboration. You should be comfortable talking to developers and sharing dashboards, PRs, and read-outs. Excited to embrace and leverage LLM-based tools to drive engineering work. You should be based in the US or Canada . Core hours are your regular workday in your timezone. Nice to haves Evidence of sustained experiment velocity (e.g., ~3+ valid experiments/month over multiple quarters). Experience working on SDKs or developer onboarding flows. Progressive delivery/feature-flag best practices ; basic experiment design/stats literacy.
