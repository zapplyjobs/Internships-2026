    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're seeking a Systems Integrity Security Engineer to design and implement security architectures for bare-metal infrastructure. You'll work with teams across Anthropic to build firmware, bootloaders, operating systems, and attestation systems to ensure the integrity of our infrastructure from the ground up. This role requires expertise in low-level systems security and the ability to architect solutions that balance security requirements with the performance demands of training AI models. What you'll do: Design and implement secure boot chains from firmware through OS initialization for diverse hardware platforms (CPUs, BMCs, peripherals, embedded microcontrollers) Architect attestation systems that provide cryptographic proof of system state from hardware root of trust through application layer Define trust boundaries and security policies for multi-party authorization systems Develop measured boot implementations and runtime integrity monitoring Create reference architectures and security requirements for bare-metal deployments Integrate security controls with infrastructure teams without impacting training performance Prototype and validate security mechanisms before production deployment Conduct firmware vulnerability assessments and penetration testing Build firmware analysis pipelines for continuous security monitoring Document security architectures and maintain threat models Collaborate with hardware vendors to ensure security capabilities meet our requirements Who you are: 8+ years of experience in systems security, with at least 5 years focused on firmware and hardware security (firmware, bootloaders, and OS-level security) Hands-on experience with secure boot, measured boot, and attestation technologies (TPM, Intel TXT, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone) Strong understanding of cryptographic protocols and hardware security modules Experience with UEFI/BIOS security, bootloader hardening, and chain of trust implementation Proficiency in low-level programming (C, Rust, Assembly) and systems programming Knowledge of firmware vulnerability assessment and threat modeling Track record of designing security architectures for complex, distributed systems Experience with supply chain security and firmware vulnerability analysis Ability to work effectively across hardware and software boundaries Knowledge of NIST firmware security guidelines and hardware security frameworks Strong candidates may also have: Experience with confidential computing technologies and hardware-based TEEs Knowledge of SLSA framework and software supply chain security standards Experience securing large-scale HPC or cloud infrastructure Contributions to open-source security projects (coreboot, CHIPSEC, etc.) Background in formal verification or security proof techniques Experience with silicon root of trust implementations Experience working with building foundational technical designs, operational leadership, and vendor collaboration Previous work with AI/ML infrastructure security Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
