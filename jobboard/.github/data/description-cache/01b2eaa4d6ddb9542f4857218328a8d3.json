    "description": "CME Group is the world’s leading derivatives marketplace — but our fastest-growing frontier is data and analytics. With trillions in notional trading across our markets, CME produces one of the richest financial datasets on the planet: full-depth order books, microstructure signals, volatility surfaces, curve dynamics, order flow distributions, term-structure shifts, and real-time global risk transfer behavior.Through our strategic partnership with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we now have unmatched compute power to analyze this data at scale and build the next generation of analytics, financial mathematical models, and AI systems.This internship gives you direct access to that ecosystem.About the RoleWe are seeking a PhD student-level intern (20 hours/week, part-time, 1–2 days onsite in Chicago) for a 12-month appointment working directly with the Executive Director leading CME’s Data & Analytics buildout. This is a ground-floor opportunity to contribute to both the modernization of CME’s core analytics and the development of new AI-driven, mathematically rigorous models.The role has three interlocking pillars:1. Rebuilding & Operationalizing CME’s Financial Mathematical ModelsCME has a deep library of proprietary models across asset classes — some long-standing and widely used, others emerging. You will help:Review and where appropriate suggest improvements to analytical models using modern numerical and statistical methodsDocument and validate models in alignment with governance and regulatory standardsWork with technology to prepare models for deployment using GCP infrastructureHelp to document and at times direct conversion of legacy codebases into robust, maintainable analytics librariesEnsure mathematical transparency, reproducibility, and version controlCollaborate with Product, Clearing, Data Science, Index, and Engineering teamsExamples of model domains include:Curve construction & interpolationVolatility modelling (e.g., SABR in depth, SVI, spline surfaces, curve fitting)Option pricing & Greeks (finite-difference / Monte Carlo)Microstructure analytics (order book modeling, liquidity metrics)Risk models (scenario generation, historical VaR, CVaR, distribution modelling)Statistical estimation for high-frequency dataPros:Rare exposure to enterprise-scale quant model developmentHands-on work with real market datasets, not simulated dataOpportunity to improve models used by global financial institutionsCons:High expectations for precision, mathematical clarity, and documentationRequires comfort with governance and validation standards2. Building New Machine Learning, Embedding, and Agent-Based ModelsYou will help shape the next generation of CME’s AI capabilities, including:ML models trained on massive historical market datasetsEmbedding models for numerical, textual, and transactional dataAgent-based systems and agent-communication protocolsMarket microstructure simulations powered by intelligent agentsPredictive analytics and anomaly detection frameworksHybrid models combining financial mathematics with ML architecturesThis work sits at the intersection of quant research and state-of-the-art AI — and will be developed directly on GCP, leveraging tools such as BigQuery, Vertex AI, and large-scale notebooks.Pros:Frontier-level ML exposure with real, large datasetsCreative freedom on prototypesReal influence on CME’s long-term AI strategyCons:Ambiguity: some initiatives start from a blank pageMust be comfortable iterating quickly and defending methodological choices3. Quant Research, Data Engineering, and Cross-Functional CollaborationYou will also:Conduct quantitative research across CME’s datasetsBuild analytical pipelines using Python + GCP toolingDevelop visualizations and explainers for internal and client useSupport monthly and quarterly research themesPresent written and verbal findings to senior leadershipHelp shape best practices for model governance, testing, and production readinessWhat You BringRequiredPhD candidate in mathematics, statistics, physics, engineering, computer science, quantitative finance, econometrics, or a related fieldStrong foundation in financial mathematics (stochastic calculus, derivatives modeling, numerical methods, or equivalent)Proficiency in Python and scientific computing librariesAbility to communicate complex concepts clearly in writingStrong analytical discipline and attention to detailSelf-starter comfortable working across multiple business linesBonusExperience with GCP: BigQuery, Vertex AI, Dataflow, C++Experience with ML, embeddings, or agent-based systemsBackground in market microstructure, derivatives, or high-frequency dataPrior publications, technical reports, or model documentationSchedule & Structure20 hours/week1–2 days onsite12-month internshipFlexible to accommodate academic commitmentsDirect mentorship and collaboration with an Executive Director leading CME’s new Data & Analytics functionThis is not a typical internship — you will be a core contributor to a strategic buildout.Why This Is a Rare Opportunity for a PhD CandidateAccess to one of the deepest financial datasets in existenceAbility to work on both quantitative financial models and cutting-edge AI systemsExperience bringing models into enterprise-scale productionDirect contribution to CME’s next-generation data analytics platformExposure to real governance, validation, and model-risk frameworksA signature line on your CV that signals:“I built models used by global markets.”CME Group is committed to offering a competitive pay package for our employee interns. The pay range typically applicable to our intern roles is $23.17--$38.65. Actual pay offered will be dependent on a wide array of factors including but not limited to: relevant experience, skills, education, location of the internship, and the internship area of focus. Through our benefits program, we offer our employee interns the opportunity to participate in select offerings. This includes our comprehensive health coverage and a mental health benefit.CME Group: Where Futures are MadeCME Group is the world’s leading derivatives marketplace. But who we are goes deeper than that. Here, you can impact markets worldwide. Transform industries. And build a career by shaping tomorrow. We invest in your success and you own it – all while working alongside a team of leading experts who inspire you in ways big and small. Problem solvers, difference makers, trailblazers. Those are our people. And we’re looking for more.At CME Group, we embrace our employees' unique experiences and skills to ensure that everyone’s perspectives are acknowledged and valued.
