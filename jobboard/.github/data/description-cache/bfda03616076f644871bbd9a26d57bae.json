    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We are looking for a Technical CBRN-E Threat Investigator to join our Threat Intelligence team. In this role, you will be responsible for detecting, investigating, and disrupting the misuse of Anthropic's AI systems for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRN-E) threats. We are particularly interested in candidates with deep expertise in either chemical defense or biodefense. You will work at the intersection of AI safety and CBRN security, conducting thorough investigations into potential misuse cases, developing novel detection techniques, and building robust defenses against threat actors who may attempt to leverage our AI technology for developing weapons, synthesizing dangerous compounds, or creating biological harm. Your specialized domain expertise will be critical to protecting against some of the most serious potential misuses of AI systems. Important context: In this position you may be exposed to explicit content spanning a range of topics, including those of a sexual, violent, or psychologically disturbing nature. This role may require responding to escalations during weekends and holidays. Responsibilities Detect and investigate attempts to misuse Anthropic's AI systems for developing, enhancing, or disseminating CBRN-E weapons, pathogens, toxins, or other threats to harm people, critical infrastructure, or the environment Conduct technical investigations using SQL, Python, and other tools to analyze large datasets, trace user behavior patterns, and uncover sophisticated CBRN-E threat actors Develop CBRN-E-specific detection capabilities, including abuse signals, tracking strategies, and detection methodologies tailored to dual-use research concerns Create actionable intelligence reports on CBRN-E attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and threat actor TTPs leveraging AI systems Conduct cross-platform threat analysis grounded in real threat actor behavior, open-source research, and publicly reported programs Collaborate with policy and enforcement teams to make informed decisions about user violations and ensure appropriate mitigation actions Engage with external stakeholders including government agencies, regulatory bodies, scientific organizations, and biosecurity/chemical security research communities Inform safety-by-design strategies by forecasting how threat actors may leverage advances in AI technology for CBRN-E purposes You may be a good fit if you Have deep domain expertise in biosecurity, chemical defense, biological weapons non-proliferation, dual-use research of concern (DURC), synthetic biology, or related CBRN-E threat domains Have demonstrated proficiency in SQL and Python for data analysis and threat detection Have experience with threat actor profiling and utilizing threat intelligence frameworks Have hands-on experience with large language models and understanding of how AI technology could be misused for CBRN-E threats Have excellent stakeholder management skills and ability to work with diverse teams including researchers, policy experts, legal teams, and external partners Can present analytical work to both technical and non-technical audiences, including government stakeholders and senior leadership Strong candidates may also have Advanced degree (MS or PhD) in biological sciences, chemistry, biodefense, biosecurity, or related field Real-world experience countering weapons of mass destruction or other high-risk asymmetric threats Experience working with government agencies or in regulated environments dealing with sensitive CBRN-E information Background in AI safety, machine learning security, or technology abuse investigation Familiarity with synthetic biology, biotechnology, or dual-use research Experience building and scaling threat detection systems or abuse monitoring programs Active Top Secret security clearance The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$230,000 - $290,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
