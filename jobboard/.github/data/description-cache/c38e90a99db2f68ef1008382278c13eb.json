    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role In the Product Designer, Claude Code role, you'll: Design for agentic workflows across surfaces. Own the experience of Claude Code across terminal, IDE extensions, web, and Slack. Design how Claude communicates progress, requests permissions, handles failures, and coordinates multi-step autonomous work. Invent new interaction patterns. Claude Code is intentionally low-level and unopinionated—a power tool for sophisticated users. Design conventions that respect developer expertise while making complex agentic behaviors feel intuitive and trustworthy. Prototype in code. This is a developer tool. You'll work directly with terminal interfaces, understand CLI constraints, and build functional prototypes. The best ideas will come from hands-on exploration, not just mockups. Ship fast and iterate. Claude Code moves quickly—new capabilities ship constantly as models improve. You'll need to design, test, and refine in tight cycles, often on critical-path work for major launches. Work fluidly across the team. Partner with engineering, research, and product without needing clear handoffs or defined lanes. Jump into problems wherever you're useful—whether that's pairing with an engineer on implementation details, exploring a new model capability with a researcher, or pressure-testing an idea with users directly. Raise the bar on craft. Obsess over the details that make power tools feel right: information density, speed, keyboard-first interaction, clear feedback loops, minimal friction. Why this role matters: Claude Code started as a research project and became one of Anthropic's most successful products, generating over $1B in annualized revenue within six months of launch. It redefined how developers work, and we're just getting started. This is genuinely new territory. We're designing the future of coding — Claude working autonomously on tasks, making decisions, asking for input when needed, and coordinating with humans throughout. The interaction patterns for this don't exist yet. We need to invent them. The product is expanding fast: from terminal to VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, to web, to Slack. Each surface brings new design challenges. And the underlying models keep getting more capable, which means the design problems keep evolving. We need designers who can move as fast as the technology—people who are excited by the ambiguity, not frustrated by it. You might be a great fit if: You live at the intersection of code and design. You genuinely enjoy developer tools and tinker with new things for fun. This role will shape how developers experience agentic coding—not just at Anthropic, but across the industry.. You're a tinkerer and explorer. You try new tools before anyone asks you to. You have opinions about terminal emulators and keyboard shortcuts. You're energized by where AI is headed—and want to be part of figuring out what comes next. Bonus points: Experience designing for command-line interfaces, IDEs or other dev tools Contributions to open source projects or developer tools Understanding of how LLMs work and their current capabilities/limitations A GitHub profile, personal site, or side projects that show what you build when no one's asking The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$260,000 - $305,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
