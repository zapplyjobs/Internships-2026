    "description": "About the teamYou will join the Generative AI team, focused on building intelligent, production-grade AI features used by enterprise customers. The team values curiosity, clear communication, and strong collaboration. You will work closely with engineers and product partners and contribute insights that help shape technical decisions and system design.What you can expectZoom is building the next generation of enterprise AI systems that power intelligent search, retrieval, and agentic workflows across Zoom products. As an AI Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer Intern, you will work on agentic retrieval and Enterprise RAG systems that operate at production scale and directly impact real users. This role sits at the intersection of large language models, retrieval systems, and production engineering. You will help design, implement, and optimize agentic pipelines that retrieve, reason over, and act on enterprise knowledge with high accuracy, low latency, and strong reliability guarantees.You will contribute to one or more of the following areas:Agentic Retrieval and RAG SystemsDesign and implement agentic retrieval pipelines that orchestrate multi-step reasoning, retrieval, and tool or function callsImprove end-to-end performance of Enterprise RAG systems, including latency, throughput, and cost efficiencyIntegrate agentic workflows with unified retrieval layers and enterprise data sourcesRetrieval Quality and EfficiencyOptimize retrieval strategies to reduce redundant calls and unnecessary context expansionImplement content compression or filtering techniques to improve reasoning efficiency while preserving answer qualityAnalyze retrieval and function-call traces to identify inefficiencies and failure patternsProduction-Grade EngineeringBuild scalable, maintainable ML and retrieval components suitable for production environmentsAdd instrumentation, logging, and evaluation hooks to measure system behavior and product impactCollaborate with engineers and researchers to transition prototypes into reliable servicesWhat we're looking for:Be currently pursuing a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related fieldHave programming skills in Python and familiarity with production ML or backend systemsHave a solid understanding of information retrieval, NLP, or machine learning fundamentalsHave experience or coursework related to LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, or agent-based systemsHave the ability to reason about system trade-offs such as accuracy, latency, and costPreferred QualificationsHave hands-on experience with LLM APIs, prompt engineering, or fine-tuningHave familiarity with search systems, vector databases, or ranking pipelinesHave exposure to agentic workflows, tool or function calling, or multi-step reasoning systemsHave experience working with real datasets and evaluating model or system performanceHave an interest in building AI systems with direct product impact, not just research prototypesWhat you will benefitHands-on experience building production-facing AI systems used at enterprise scaleExposure to state-of-the-art agentic retrieval and Enterprise RAG architecturesMentorship from experienced AI engineers and ML practitionersOpportunity to see your work influence real Zoom products and user experiencesA strong foundation for a career in applied AI, ML engineering, or AI platform developmentSalary Range or On Target Earnings:Minimum:$66.50Maximum:$106.50In addition to the base salary and/or OTE listed Zoom has a Total Direct Compensation philosophy that takes into consideration; base salary, bonus and equity value.Note: Starting pay will be based on a number of factors and commensurate with qualifications & experience.We also have a location based compensation structure;  there may be a different range for candidates in this and other locations.Ways of WorkingOur structured hybrid approach is centered around our offices and remote work environments.
