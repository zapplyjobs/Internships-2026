    "description": "Software Engineer - Rust / Bevy / WebGPULos Angeles, CA / New York, NY / Austin, TXEngineering, Product, Design – Software Engineering /Full-time /On-siteApply for this jobAbout NominalNominal is building the software infrastructure that powers the world’s most advanced hardware systems — from spacecraft and autonomous vehicles to next-generation industrial machines. Our platform ingests high-rate telemetry, validates complex autonomy software in real time, and helps engineering teams iterate faster without sacrificing safety or precision. We’re a small, fast-moving team of engineers and operators who own problems end-to-end, work across disciplines, and thrive on solving challenges at the intersection of hardware and software. As a dual-use platform, we're serving top-tier commercial and defense customers, including the U.S. Navy, United States Air Force, Shield AI, and Anduril.We’re backed by top-tier investors — Sequoia, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lux Capital, and Lightspeed Ventures — who share our mission to accelerate innovation in mission-critical systems. Our team brings experience from SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition, and other leading companies, united by a common goal: enabling hardware engineers to push the boundaries of advanced technology with speed, safety, and precision.As a Rust Visualization & Systems Engineer, you’ll design and implement the real-time 3D and UI layers that let engineers explore complex telemetry, simulations, and control systems. You’ll work directly with our data pipelines and physics engines to render live system state using Bevy, WebGPU, and egui, bringing real-world data to life in a fast, intuitive, and extensible way. If you love writing elegant, high-performance Rust, designing immersive visualization systems, and making real-time data beautiful and responsive, we’d love to meet you.🚀 About the RoleBuild interactive 3D and 2D visualizations using Bevy and WebGPU, optimized for real-time telemetry and simulation.Develop advanced ECS-based rendering and scene-graph systems for large-scale, dynamic data environments.Design and implement egui-based UIs for real-time control, telemetry playback, and system monitoring.Collaborate with data infrastructure engineers to stream and visualize high-frequency telemetry with minimal latency.Contribute to cross-platform runtime architecture supporting both native and WebAssembly builds.Profile and optimize performance across CPU, GPU, and memory boundaries to achieve smooth frame pacing and determinism.Shape the visual and interaction paradigms that define Nominal’s end-user experience for engineers working on mission-critical hardware.⚡ Skills That Accelerate Us4+ years of experience building performance-critical applications in Rust (or equivalent systems languages).Deep familiarity with Bevy, including custom ECS components, render pipelines, and asset systems.Hands-on experience with WebGPU or wgpu, including shader programming (WGSL/GLSL) and real-time rendering concepts.UI experience with egui or other immediate-mode frameworks; ability to design responsive, intuitive technical interfaces.Strong understanding of game engine and simulation architecture — scenes, entities, transforms, and event systems.Familiarity with real-time data visualization, 3D math, and asynchronous data streams (e.g., telemetry, sensor feeds).Comfortable working across low-level graphics code and high-level UX — from optimizing GPU passes to polishing user interactions.Bonus: experience with Rust async ecosystems, Polars / Arrow, or gRPC / WebSocket streaming backends.Bonus: contributions to open-source Rust projects (Bevy, egui, wgpu, or similar).✨ Benefits/Perks🏥 100% coverage of medical, dental, and vision insurance🏖️ Unlimited PTO and sick leave🍽️ Free lunch, snacks, and coffee🚀 Professional Development Stipend🛠️ In-office hardware lab with a $250 project stipend✈️ Annual company retreat$120,000 - $180,000 a yearThe listed salary range represents an estimate for base compensation only. Base salary is just one part of the total rewards package. Eligible employees may also receive highly competitive equity grants in the form of stock options, allowing you to share in the company’s long-term success.All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. ITAR RequirementsTo conform to U.S. Government export regulations, applicant must be a (i) U.S. citizen or national, (ii) U.S. lawful, permanent resident (aka green card holder), (iii) Refugee under 8 U.S.C. § 1157, or (iv) Asylee under 8 U.S.C. § 1158, or be eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
