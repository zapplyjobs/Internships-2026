    "description": "About Supabase Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth. About the Role We’re looking for an experienced Database Support Engineer to join our Support Team and help developers unblock complex issues, build more reliably, and get the most out of the Supabase platform. You’ll work closely with customers and engineering, helping us improve product quality and developer experience based on real-world usage. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments and is excited about building developer tools that scale to millions. What You’ll Be Responsible for In this role, you’ll: Investigate and resolve advanced customer issues across Postgres, Auth, RLS, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions, and client libraries. Provide consultative, proactive advice to optimize workloads, avoid common pitfalls, and tailored advice to our most advanced users. Reproduce bugs, isolate root causes, propose workarounds, and escalate to engineering with solid repro steps. Ask smart, targeted questions that turn incomplete reports into actionable cases. Communicate clearly and empathetically with customer users of all levels—especially during high-impact or time-sensitive situations. Spot patterns across tickets and recommend improvements to docs, tooling, and the product itself. Mentor junior team members and help raise the overall bar for support quality. You Might Be a Good Fit If You You have 6+ years in technical support, backend engineering, SRE, or similar. You know PostgreSQL deeply—autovacuum behavior, WAL growth, long-running transactions, table bloat, and other internals. You’re strong in high-performance SQL and query optimization. You’re comfortable troubleshooting complex setups, including multi-tenant schema patterns. You can debug edge functions and understand distributed system behavior when failures get tricky. You’ve handled data migration issues (pg_dump/restore, schema drift, failed migrations) and know how to recover safely. You have hands-on experience with cloud hosting providers like AWS. You’re comfortable in terminal and Linux environments. You thrive in high-volume situations and can form/test assumptions quickly.
