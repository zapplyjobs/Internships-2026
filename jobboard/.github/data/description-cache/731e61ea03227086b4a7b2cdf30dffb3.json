Salary Region 2: 36 USDCompany DescriptionIt started with a simple idea: what if surgery could be less invasive and recovery less painful? Nearly 30 years later, that question still fuels everything we do at Intuitive. As a global leader in robotic-assisted surgery and minimally invasive care, our technologies—like the da Vinci surgical system and Ion—have transformed how care is delivered for millions of patients worldwide.We’re a team of engineers, clinicians, and innovators united by one purpose: to make surgery smarter, safer, and more human. Every day, our work helps care teams perform with greater precision and patients recover faster, improving outcomes around the world.The problems we solve demand creativity, rigor, and collaboration. The work is challenging, but deeply meaningful—because every improvement we make has the potential to change a life.If you’re ready to contribute to something bigger than yourself and help transform the future of healthcare, you’ll find your purpose here.Job DescriptionPrimary Function of Position Imaging System Analysts Pipeline team is part of da Vinci robotic surgical system multi-port organization. It is responsible for delivering the surgical robot’s vision sub-system image processing algorithm, vision pipeline design and image quality (IQ) optimization. As a Camera Image Processing Algorithm Intern, you’ll benchmark, develop and optimize new imaging algorithms to enhance vision pipeline perceptual IQ, for real-time surgical decision-making tasks. You’ll develop an understanding of surgical robot vision sub-system design, its imaging challenges and root causes. You will gain hands-on experience in practical image processing algorithm design, implementation and IQ optimization.Essential Job Duties Evaluate and benchmark existing imaging processing algorithms and pipeline performance. Identify root cause of IQ issues and solution space constraints.Design, implement and optimize new algorithms with vision pipeline simulator.Algorithm and pipeline calibration, IQ validation lab work and documentation.Obtain surgical feedback from clinical development team and iterate into algorithm designs and optimization.QualificationsRequired Skills and ExperienceKnowledgeable and significant hands-on experience in designing and implementing digital image and video signal processing algorithms.Good knowledge about color science, human perception and image quality metrics.Solid imaging-related physics knowledge and mathematical modeling foundation.Proficient in Matlab, Python and C/C++ algorithm prototyping.Good machine learning knowledge and hands-on experience applying deep learning-based methods to image or video processing problemsUniversity Hiring Program Eligibility Requirements:University Enrollment: Must be currently enrolled in and returning to an accredited degree-seeking academic program after the internship.Internship Work Period: Must be available to work full-time (approximately 40 hours per week) during a 10-12 week period starting May or June. Specific start dates are shared during the recruiting process.Required Education and Training Current enrollment in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Imaging Science or related degree-seeking program at the Master’s, or Doctorate level.Working Conditions (As applicable - Any physical requirements for the job. If not applicable, state “none”)None.Preferred Skills and ExperienceHigh dynamic range imaging knowledge and experience, especially tone-mapping algorithms.Experience with PyTorch (preferred) or similar deep learning frameworks for image enhancement or computer vision applicationsGPU programming experience with CUDAFamiliar with CMOS image sensor, camera optics, and its signal processing pipeline.Additional InformationDue to the nature of our business and the role, please note that Intuitive and/or your customer(s) may require that you show current proof of vaccination against certain diseases including COVID-19. Details can vary by role.Intuitive is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

For any Intuitive role subject to export controls, final offers are contingent upon obtaining an approved export license and/or an executed TCP prior to the prospective employee’s start date, which may or may not be flexible, and within a timeframe that does not unreasonably impede the hiring need. If applicable, candidates will be notified and instructed on any requirements for these purposes. We will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records in accordance with fair chance laws.We provide market-competitive compensation packages, inclusive of base pay (paid at an hourly rate), benefits, and a housing allowance. It would not be typical for someone to be hired at the top end of range for the role, as actual pay will be determined based on several factors, including relevant skills and experience for this internship, degree-seeking academic program (PhD, Master’s, Bachelor’s, etc), year in school, and location. The hourly rate is prorated against the intern program salaries listed and total program compensation will be based on internship duration.I'm interestedI'm interestedPrivacy Policy",
