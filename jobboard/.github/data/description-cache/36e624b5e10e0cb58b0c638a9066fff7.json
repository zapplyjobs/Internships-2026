    "description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. By the Numbers: Named #1 best software for small business of 2024 by G2 2,700+ employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Turkiye and growing Over $500M in annual revenue The SMB market is large (and growing!) with huge opportunities for Gusto to make an incredible impact for SMBs There are 6.2M employers in the US, 98% have fewer than 100 employees (1) 550,000 new businesses are created each year in the US (1) What Product Management is like at Gusto: We’re looking for high-autonomy, entrepreneurial Product Managers to build high-impact solutions for small businesses and their employees. We believe in high-ownership Product Managers who operate like business owners — owning an entire roadmap end to end and shipping product all the way from strategy through to the nitty-gritty details (some describe this kind of role as a “GM” type role). Our Product team is lean, which means you’ll have a high degree of impact and ownership. We believe in smaller, empowered teams that move quickly with less overhead. You’ll move fast by pairing sharp product judgment with fluency in AI tools — automating what slows teams down and amplifying what makes them creative and high-performing. We’re boundaryless builders. Lines between roles are intentionally blurred, and our PMs do whatever it takes to deliver outcomes. You’ll prototype, automate, design, and ship — using AI as your co-builder to turn problems into durable solutions that deliver customer value with urgency and care. We’re here to serve small and medium businesses. Gusto has a strong mission-driven culture, and we care deeply about lifting up these business owners — building technology for an AI-first world that gives them the superpowers to run and grow their businesses with confidence. We’re comfortable with change. Our environment moves fast, and PMs here thrive in ambiguity — blending curiosity, experimentation, and AI-native craft to shape how products (and work itself) are built at Gusto. About the Team: Gusto Solo is our newest product offering, designed to help solopreneurs seamlessly pay themselves and manage their businesses — all in one compliant, easy-to-use intelligent platform. As the Principal Product Manager, you’ll chart the course for Gusto Solo’s next phase of growth. With the MVP now live, this role is about scaling — shaping the vision, deepening product-market fit, and unlocking new, AI-powered opportunities for solopreneurs. You’ll collaborate closely with a fully staffed, high-performing cross-functional team that’s passionate about serving this customer base. This is a critical role — your work will directly shape one of Gusto’s key growth drivers and define what an AI-first customer experience looks like for millions of small business owners. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Own the vision and strategy. Set the long-term direction for Gusto Solo — defining the big problems we can solve well and building toward durable competitive advantage. You’ll do this by continuously uncovering and deeply understanding customer needs, testing risky assumptions, running lean experiments, and staying close to trends and the market environment as the product evolves toward product–market fit. Collaborate and influence. Partner across every function — Engineering, Design, Data Science, Service Delivery, Marketing, Finance, and more — to bring your bold vision to life. You’ll rally cross-functional teams and leaders around a shared strategy, building alignment and momentum to make that vision a reality. Make it happen. Be the pace setter. Drive execution as a boundariless builder — doing whatever it takes to achieve outcomes. You will use AI as your co-builder to turn complex problems into durable, customer-loved solutions with urgency and care. Here’s what we're looking for: 8+ years of hands-on Product Management experience Proven track record of building 0→1 products and scaling them into their next chapter of high growth. You’re a builder at heart — entrepreneurial, curious, fluent, and stay up to date AI tools that help you move faster and think bigger. You’ve built or scaled AI-first products (whether at work or on your own) and see AI as a co-builder that expands what’s possible. Experienced in building with modern AI systems — from prompting and fine-tuning to evaluating outputs and shipping reliable, user-facing experiences . Experience building and scaling products in high growth startups and highly regulated domains (e.g., Fintech, Accounting, Taxes, Payroll) — you understand how to design systems that are both compliant and customer-obsessed. GTM excellence — you’ve partnered with Marketing to craft promise→payoff, pricing/packaging, and lifecycle activation strategies that drive adoption and retention. Exceptional collaboration and storytelling. You build trust quickly, drive alignment across teams, and communicate a compelling vision that inspires action. If you don't think you meet all of the criteria above but still are interested in the job, please apply. Nobody checks every box, and we're looking for someone excited to join the team. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $179,000/yr to $224,000/yr in Denver & most major metro locations, and $210,000/yr to $263,000/yr for San Francisco, Seattle & New York. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate location, experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. Where do PMs at Gusto work? We have offices in Denver, San Francisco, and New York and have remote team members across the US and Canada.
