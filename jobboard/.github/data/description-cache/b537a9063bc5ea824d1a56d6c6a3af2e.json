We provide strategic advice and guidance to all Brex teams, protect Brex, advise on risk, and represent the company externally, negotiating with partners and interacting with regulators. Reimagining the financial system in a highly regulated environment requires creativity and resourcefulness, and we welcome the challenge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Where you’ll work&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;This role will be based in our San Francisco office. We are a hybrid environment that combines the energy and connections of being in the office with the benefits and flexibility of working from home. We currently require a minimum of two coordinated days in the office per week, Wednesday and Thursday. Starting February 2, 2026, we will require three days per week in office - Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. As a perk, we also have up to four weeks per year of fully remote work!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What you&amp;#39;ll do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’re here to identify, assess and mitigate potential legal risks to Brex to drive risk-adjusted business outcomes while protecting Brex. You’ll provide subject matter expertise on litigation/arbitration disputes and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, from initial communications through final resolution. You’ll collaborate directly with stakeholders (including compliance, customer support, finance, and go-to-market) to devise and implement creative solutions to risk-related matters. You will regularly identify strategic opportunities to manage risk and protect the company’s brand over the long term rather than triaging dispute-by-dispute. Additionally, you will manage costs by knowing when to find a solution in-house and when and how to strategically and cost-effectively deploy outside counsel.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Identify legal risks facing the company and develop and implement strategies for mitigating those risks while successfully enabling the company’s business objectives&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation / arbitration disputes from commencement through resolution, providing appropriate updates to cross-functional partners and leadership regarding risk, financial impact, and opportunities to resolve&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Partner closely with Compliance and other departments to provide pragmatic and actionable advice, develop new policies, or implement strategic revisions to existing policies/procedures as part of the company’s risk management&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Advise the customer service organization and operational teams regarding customer escalations and customer disputes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Respond timely to requests for information and subpoenas from regulators and others, and assist the company in developing strong procedures for compliance with these requests&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monitor trends and legal developments, particularly those that impact the financial services and technology industries, analyze the implications for the company, and ensure the company is well-positioned to respond and react accordingly&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Requirements&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;4+ years working experience in law firms and/or in-house, with a preference for fintech and in-house experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deep experience in litigation, arbitration, and/or regulatory enforcement actions, including responsibility for independently managing complex disputes with customers, regulators, third parties, or others from commencement to resolution&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience managing outside counsel and exercising strong judgment for disputes not being resolved in-house&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience in supporting customer service or operations organizations&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent written and verbal communication skills, both internal (memos, guides, presentations) and external (counterparties, regulator communications)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ownership mentality and comfort working on complex matters that require judgment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Entrepreneurial mindset and ability to work in a fast paced environment&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Willingness to be a team player that pitches in to help out on other products and topics; one of our key tenets is “One Brex”&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Law degree and admitted to practice in at least one jurisdiction&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bonus Points&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with corporate bankruptcy&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience interacting directly with financial regulatory agencies&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Compensation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The expected salary range for this role is $220,000-$270,000 USD.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the starting base pay will depend on a number of factors, including the candidate’s location, skills, experience, market demands, and internal pay parity.
