You identify compelling AI use cases, work directly with customers to extract their stories, and create detailed, demo-led content. You write the narrative, create the demo, and ensure every story teaches something specific. You're deeply curious—the kind of person who asks \"why did you build it that way?\" and \"what happens when X breaks?\" until you truly understand not just what the customer built, but why it matters and how it works.You’re looking to pioneer a new approach—customer stories, demos, testimonials, and use cases that show real people solving specific problems with working demos. Not corporate hand-waves, but real builders—by name, by role, by actual challenge—demonstrating their AI-powered Airtable implementations. Success in this role is not program management, it’s developing engaging content that positions our builders as AI leaders. What you'll do Customer Story Development & Execution Identify and qualify high-impact AI use cases solving real business problems at scale Conduct deep-dive customer interviews to understand workflows, challenges, and outcomes in detail, asking questions until you really understand Lead demo sessions where customers walk through their builds.

You can interview a customer, understand what they built, and translate it into a narrative that others strive to replicate. You use AI tools daily to transform how you work: transcription, synthesis, drafting, editing, research. You see AI as a force multiplier. You have strong opinions about what makes a customer story exceptional—accessible, credible, and outcome-driven. Your stories make it easy for others to see how they can apply the solution to their own work, backed by real results that inspire action. You're great at earning customer trust and managing executive time.
