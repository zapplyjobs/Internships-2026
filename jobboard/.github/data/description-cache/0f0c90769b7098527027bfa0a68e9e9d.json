    "description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About the Role: We’re looking for an FP&A Manager, GTM to join our Finance team. You’ll be the financial lead for our go-to-market organizations, managing OpEx, headcount, and commissions forecasting while building systems and workflows that scale. You’ll partner cross-functionally with RevOps, Strategic Finance, and Talent to ensure investment decisions are aligned with business goals and budget targets and backed by precision. If you’re based within a pre-determined commuting distance of one of our offices (SF, NY, London, or Berlin), the role includes in-office anchor days on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. If you're located beyond that distance, the role is fully remote. For location-specific details, please connect with our recruiting team. What You Will Do: Own the GTM budget envelope – Manage OpEx and headcount budgets for our largest teams. Ensure initiatives are fully funded and stay within burn targets, partnering with StratFin on growth, ROI, and unit economics. Drive dollar-based headcount planning – Shift planning from “headcount adds” to a detailed bottoms up approach, aligning with org structures. Collaborate with RevOps, Talent, and StratFin to balance sales and marketing resources with financial constraints. Reinvent the Monthly Business Review – Own GTM budget vs. actuals (BvA) meetings. Automate variance reporting to remove admin work and focus the conversation on decision-making. Forecast with precision – Lead forecasting for sales and marketing, inclusive of vendor and headcount spend, partnering with Accounting to eliminate blind spots in our outlook. Design frictionless controls – Design approval workflows (for headcount backfills, vendor spend, T&E) that are rigorous but fast. You will use technology to approve the routine and flag the exceptions, avoiding \"bottleneck bureaucracy.\" System Implementation – Drive GTM system implementations from a finance perspective, aligning planning, reporting, and forecasting workflows to support scale, automation, and consistent measurement of performance. About You: Anti-bureaucracy, pro-speed – You streamline workflows, remove drag, and make decisions with clarity. You believe a 3-bullet Slack post with a clear recommendation is better than a 20-slide deck. Tech-forward operator – You go beyond Excel. You use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) to automate, clean, and generate insights. You treat Finance like a product—always shipping improvements. Detail-obsessed – You know that a single error in commission logic or start dates can swing the forecast by millions. You sweat the details so the CFO doesn’t have to. Benefits: Competitive compensation package, including equity. Inclusive Healthcare Package. Learn and Grow - we provide mentorship and send you to events that help you build your network and skills. Flexible Time Off. We will provide you the gear you need to do your role, and a WFH budget for you to outfit your space as needed. The San Francisco, CA base pay range for this role is $160,000 - $210,000. Actual salary will be based on job-related skills, experience, and location. Compensation outside of San Francisco may be adjusted based on employee location. The total compensation package may include benefits, equity-based compensation, and eligibility for a company bonus or variable pay program depending on the role.
