    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Anthropic is bringing Claude to democracies worldwide, and we’re looking for startup-minded engineers to build out our public sector engineering team. Engineers in this role will be working across the stack to scale our products from 0 to 1 and beyond. While we’re looking for candidates with prior public sector experience, we are also excited about hiring product-minded engineers with a track record of building and scaling products. There’s no shortage of things to build, so startup experience will help in maintaining a sharp focus and plotting an optimal path forward. This role is full-stack and entrepreneurial: you’ll own projects such as building out deployments for new government customers, implementing products to better surface critical information, and working directly with customers to understand how we can best leverage and adapt Claude to power their workflows. You’d be joining at an exciting inflection point where we are evolving past deployments of basic Claude access for the public sector and toward cutting-edge AI capabilities and a comprehensive public sector experience. The projects the team tackles enables governments to deploy AI applications for their most critical operations—from national security to public services. As the team continues to grow, our focus includes delivering solutions that directly influence how democratic institutions deploy and use advanced AI systems. Core Responsibilities Build specialized AI applications and products for governments by developing deep understanding of their processes and workflows Take ownership of architecting new deployments and designing public sector specific features Collaborate closely with research on AI models for government applications and workflows Partner directly with government customers and internal go-to-market teams to translate requirements into technical and product roadmaps Design and build scalable systems for deployment, user management, and administrative controls Create clarity and technical direction in a fast-moving environment with unique constraints You Might Be a Good Fit If You: Have 6+ years of experience as a full stack software engineer Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities Strong technical background with proven success building and shipping enterprise or government-grade products Have excellent collaboration skills, with ability to work effectively across functions Strong Candidates May Also Have: Startup experience, particularly in scaling products from zero to one Experience partnering with sales, customer success, and professional services teams to drive product adoption Experience delivering software to government networks Active federal security clearance (Secret or above) This position requires verification of U.S. citizenship due to citizenship-based legal restrictions.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
