    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p><strong>What Does Steel Dynamics Do?</strong></p> <p>Steel Dynamics is a leading industrial metals solutions company that produces lower-carbon, high-quality steel products primarily from recycled scrap. Operating through a circular manufacturing model, the company manufactures a wide range of steel products including flat roll, structural, and long products for industries such as construction, automotive, energy, and manufacturing. In addition to steel production, Steel Dynamics operates metals recycling facilities, steel fabrication plants, and aluminum production operations, serving customers across North America with a focus on innovation, efficiency, and sustainability.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What Makes This Internship Different?</strong>Steel Dynamics’ metallurgy internships stand apart from others in the market because they provide a true balance of office-based engineering work and hands-on industrial experience. Interns are not confined to observing from a distance; instead, they actively work alongside operators and maintenance teams on the production floor, applying engineering principles directly to equipment, systems, and processes. This immersive approach gives interns the opportunity to design solutions, test them in real-world conditions, and see the immediate impact of their work. At SDI, metallurgy is not limited to research and development, it is a dynamic combination of technical analysis and practical application that exposes interns to the full scope of how metallurgy drives production success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Internship Location</strong></p> <p>This internship is located at the Steel Dynamics Columbus Flat Roll Division located in Columbus, MS, in the Quality Department.
