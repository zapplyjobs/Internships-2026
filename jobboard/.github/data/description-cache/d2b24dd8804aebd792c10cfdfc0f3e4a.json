    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We are looking for a Technical Cyber Threat Investigator to join our Threat Intelligence team. In this role, you will be responsible for detecting, investigating, and disrupting the misuse of Anthropic's AI systems for malicious cyber operations. You will work at the intersection of AI safety and cybersecurity, conducting thorough investigations into potential misuse cases, developing novel detection techniques, and building robust defenses against emerging cyber threats in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-enabled risks. Your work will directly protect the broader ecosystem from sophisticated threat actors who seek to leverage AI technology for harm. Important context: In this position you may be exposed to explicit content spanning a range of topics, including those of a sexual, violent, or psychologically disturbing nature. This role may require responding to escalations during weekends and holidays. Responsibilities Detect and investigate attempts to misuse Anthropic's AI systems for cyber operations, including influence operations, malware development, social engineering, and other adversarial activities Develop abuse signals and tracking strategies to proactively detect sophisticated threat actors across our platform Create actionable intelligence reports on new attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and threat actor TTPs targeting LLM systems Conduct cross-platform threat analysis grounded in real threat actor behavior, using open-source research, dark web monitoring, and internal data Utilize investigation findings to implement systematic improvements to our safety approach and mitigate harm at scale Study trends internally and in the broader ecosystem to anticipate how AI systems could be misused, generating and publishing reports Build and maintain relationships with external threat intelligence partners, information sharing communities, and government stakeholders Work cross-functionally to build out our threat intelligence program, establishing processes, tools, and best practices You may be a good fit if you Have demonstrated proficiency in SQL and Python for data analysis and threat detection Have experience with large language models and understanding of how AI technology could be misused for cyber threats Have subject matter expertise in abusive user behavior detection, such as influence operations, coordinated inauthentic behavior, or cyber threat intelligence Have experience tracking threat actors across surface, deep, and dark web environments Can derive insights from large datasets to make key decisions and recommendations Have experience with threat actor profiling and utilizing threat intelligence frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, etc.) Have strong project management skills and ability to build processes from the ground up Possess excellent communication skills to collaborate with cross-functional teams and present to leadership Strong candidates may also have Experience working with government agencies or in regulated environments Background in AI safety, machine learning security, or technology abuse investigation Experience building and scaling threat detection systems or abuse monitoring programs Active Top Secret security clearance Deadline to apply None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
