Inspired by a legacy of innovating for the benefit of others, our mission is to challenge the current state of mobility through human-centric innovation — expanding what “mobility” means and how it serves society.Our work centers on four pillars: AD/ADAS, our autonomous driving and advanced driver assist technologies; Arene, our software development platform for software-defined vehicles; Woven City, a test course for mobility; and Cloud & AI, the digital infrastructure powering our collaborative foundation. Business-critical functions empower these teams to execute, and together, we’re working toward one bold goal: a world with zero accidents and enhanced well-being for all.TEAMAt Woven by Toyota, we work on a diverse set of problems ranging from solving optimization problems in 3D geometric computer vision, to minimizing latency on hardware accelerators, designing novel neural network architectures and applying and advancing the state-of-the-art of machine learning (ML) for perception, prediction, and motion planning. The Perception team is looking for a strong candidate in machine learning to join our 2025 intern program. During this time you will be working alongside our world class machine learning engineers to further push the boundaries of our state-of-the-art perception system for autonomous driving. Your future colleagues are experts in machine learning within the domain of autonomous driving and have developed and deployed numerous deep learning models throughout the entire software stack. This is an excellent opportunity for you to learn from them and make and have an impact on society. WHAT WE’LL GIVE YOUThe objective of this internship is for you to acquire hands-on industry experience and conduct research within the domain of autonomous driving. This will give you the opportunity to make use of our mature machine learning infrastructure as well as a massive amount of data for you to experiment with and ultimately to improve our system. The focus should be on research and ultimately deploying your work onto our prototype vehicles, which you will have the opportunity to experience on public roads. Woven by Toyota internships are structured to ensure you grow both technically and professionally. You will get a chance to work on real projects that affect future key results of our mission, while receiving constant feedback, with clear goals. You'll be supported by mentors and managers throughout your internship. At the end of the internship, you will share the results of your project with the team, and others that may be interested in your work.RESPONSIBILITIESPerception ML model R&D by prototyping, validating and iterating on existing and new model architectures.Own development of a new model functionality end-to-end.
