    "description": "Business UnitWhat the Role EntailsAbout Tencent AI Lab at Seattle AreaTencent is a leading internet company in China. Tencent AI Lab at Seattle Area was established in May 2017. The lab strives to continuously improve AI's capability in perception, cognition, and creativity. Researchers there aim at solving challenging real-world problems with advanced technologies and publish extensively at top conferences and journals.Research Internship – Reinforcement Learning for Large Foundation ModelsTencent AI Lab is dedicated to advancing cutting-edge AI technologies, with a particular focus on innovative breakthroughs in large foundation models. The lab's long-term ambition is to drive the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). We are currently seeking research interns for the year of 2026, in the area of reinforcement learning (RL) for large foundation models, with an emphasis on developing stable and efficient RL algorithms. The goal is to empower large foundation models in complex reasoning ang agent tasks and enhance their capabilities in autonomous exploration and continuous learning. Our Seattle area office is located in Bellevue WA.Every research intern will work with researchers on a research project aimed at attacking one of the core problems on the design and optimization of RL algorithms for large foundation models. Research areas include but are not limited to Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, Reward Modeling, and World Models. We will conduct large-scale experiments of RL algorithms in scenarios such as complex reasoning and autonomous agents, deliver impactful algorithms for real world applications, and publish influential research papers.Who We Look ForRequirements & QualificationsThe ideal intern candidates are those whoPh.D. in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or related fields from a top university,are self-motivated and excited about developing novel techniques,have research experiences in natural language processing or machine learning,are proficient in Python programming and experienced in developing with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.have good publication track records and history of creativity and intellectual flexibility,have excellent communication and teamwork skills, capable of collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive project success and innovation.Intern duration: 3 months (with the possibility of extension). Can start any time in the year 2026.Location State(s)US-Washington-BellevueThe expected base pay range for this position in the location(s) listed above is $80,169.00 to $120,000.14 per year.
