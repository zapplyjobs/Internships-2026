    "description": "Research Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world&#39;s best researchers, Research Interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Research Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, Research Interns are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other Research Interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer. Design and implement research prototypes for real-time situated and adaptive interaction. Explore the use of the latest generative AI techniques related to interpreting multimodal interaction, conversation, and behavioral signals. Conduct user studies and analyze multimodal data. Contribute to publications and share findings with the research community. Designed, implemented, and evaluated different personality styles for AI agents, varying factors such as communication style, voice characteristics, and emotional tone to study their impact on user experience, engagement, and trust. Working with multimodal AI models Currently enrolled in a PhD or equivalent program in HCI, HRI, Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Robotics, Electrical Engineering, Psychology, or related STEM field. At least 2 years of research experience using human-centered approaches in HCI, HRI, ML, CV, or Affective Computing. In addition to the qualifications below, you&#39;ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position as well as a cover letter and any relevant work or research samples. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf. Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance, so they will be ready to submit your letter. Please include a cover letter indicating which of the research topics you are most interested in and aligned with. Be sure to indicate which of the specific preferred qualifications (listed below) you possess. We are looking for some combination of the following qualifications (please address these in your cover letter): Experience writing peer-reviewed publications. Experience with generative AI techniques, ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch), and real-time interactive systems. Strong collaboration and communication skills. Conducting human-subjects research. Experience implementing research prototypes (frontend, backend, or both). Using human-centered design &amp; research methods. Familiarity with reinforcement learning or time-series signal processing. Working with large datasets (e.g., text, vision, physiology, behavioral). Experience collecting data with wearable devices. Experience prototyping real-time conversational AI agents using tools such as the OpenAI Realtime API, including function calling, and supporting interactions via text, voice, and other interfaces.",
