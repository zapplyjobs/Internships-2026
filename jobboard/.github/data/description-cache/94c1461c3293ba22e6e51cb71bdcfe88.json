    "description": "2026 Summer Intern - Data & Digital CatalystsDepartment SummaryA healthier future. It’s what drives us to innovate. To continuously advance science and ensure everyone has access to the healthcare they need today and for generations to come. Creating a world where we all have more time with the people we love. That’s what makes us Roche. Advances in AI, data, and computational sciences are transforming drug discovery and development. Roche’s Research and Early Development organisations at Genentech (gRED) and Pharma (pRED) have demonstrated how these technologies accelerate R&D, leveraging data and novel computational models to drive impact. Seamless data sharing and access to models across gRED and pRED are essential to maximising these opportunities. The new computational sciences Center of Excellence (CoE) is a strategic, unified group whose goal is to harness this transformative power of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist our scientists in both pRED and gRED to deliver more innovative and transformative medicines for patients worldwide.Within the CoE organisation, the Data and Digital Catalyst organisation drives the modernisation of our computational and data ecosystems and integration of digital technologies across Research and Early Development to enable our stakeholders, power data-driven science and accelerate decision-making.This internship position is located in South San Francisco, on-site.The OpportunityOur platform Identity & Access Management (IAM) team has developed the foundational tools needed to build scientific software solutions using security best practices in AWS, but often the scientific computing community at Roche does not utilize them fully because advanced capabilities appear complex. We’d love to make these advanced capabilities easy to use so the whole organization can leverage AWS, and Roche’s data, to its fullest, securely.We are looking for a junior engineer to help make these advanced concepts easy for the scientific community at Roche to understand and implement into their software solutions, through example solutions and architectures.
