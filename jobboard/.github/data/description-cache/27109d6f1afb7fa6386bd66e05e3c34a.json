    "description": "Join us on the journey to get to net zero Our Mission Enable organizations to reduce, remove, and utilize their emissions with carbon science. We are a purpose-driven carbon management firm dedicated to helping organizations around the world reach their climate goals. We make carbon science accessible and actionable with our team of leading scientists and an end-to-end carbon management platform. Global citizens with global impact Whether a scientist, developer, or carbon markets expert, we are united by our mission to take climate action now. We are experts in our fields, and we act with confidence. We are located across 4 countries and in states all across the U.S. Diverse backgrounds bring diverse perspectives We recognize that teams with diverse backgrounds and different experiences are powerful. Bringing together a variety of individual perspectives enhances how we can effectively address the climate crisis. Together, we are creating an environment where everyone is celebrated, and anyone can succeed. About Carbon Direct Carbon Direct is a science-first organization that combines technology with deep expertise in climate science, data, and policy to deliver actionable climate strategies and high-quality carbon dioxide removal to decarbonize the global economy. We have built a reputation as a trusted arbiter of high-quality strategy for carbon reduction, removal, and utilization throughout value chains, working with leading organizations. Our team of 70+ scientists includes thought leaders who actively contribute to the science of climate mitigation with novel assessment methodologies and public resources to facilitate action. With Carbon Direct, clients can set and equitably deliver on their climate commitments, streamline compliance, and manage risk through transparency and scientific credibility. Carbon Direct has applied its expertise to the completion of: over 600 engineered, hybrid, and nature-based carbon credit project assessments, deep diligence for multi-year off-take agreements, and project co-design engagements; over 150 unique emerging technology diligence reviews; and deep technical diligence de-risking engagements in improved forest management, reforestation, BECCS, and DAC, with commercial strategy support in collaboration with carbon credit developers to ensure that their products are best-in-class. Overview We are seeking motivated energy and climate technology professionals to join our Industrial Decarbonization Intern Program in 2026. Successful candidates will support research, modeling, analysis, and writing tasks that help solve climate change through the management of physical CO2. This internship provides an opportunity to work on cutting-edge solutions for reducing and removing CO2 emissions, including clean fuels, carbon capture and storage, low-carbon building materials, and engineered carbon dioxide removal technologies. Our work environment is fast-paced and collaborative, and the role may involve occasional travel. We value flexibility, curiosity, and the ability to work both independently and as part of a team. A successful candidate is a self-starter who understands the fundamentals of low-carbon energy systems, stays informed about technological developments in climate and sustainability, and is eager to contribute to scalable and equitable climate solutions. Responsibilities: Conduct research, modeling, expert interviews, and data analysis to support industrial decarbonization projects. Assist in research, synthesis, writing, and preparation of presentation materials as directed by team members. Participate in collaborative problem-solving with project teams. Support internal communication and coordination across teams to achieve project goals. Develop and contribute to clear and compelling reports, briefs, and presentations summarizing analytical insights. Manage deadlines through effective time management and communication with mentors and project leads. Get to know Carbon Direct and our science-based approach to decarbonization through 1:1, small group, departmental, and company-wide dialogues. Qualifications: Current graduate student (or recent college graduate) in engineering, chemistry, earth sciences, physics, environmental science, or a related field. Interest in carbon management solutions, including decarbonization and carbon removal technologies. Experience or coursework in one or more of the following: Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) and/or Techno-Economic Assessments (TEA) Carbon markets (voluntary or compliance) and relevant standards Emissions mitigation strategies such as efficiency, electrification, carbon capture and storage, and fuel switching Engineered and hybrid carbon removal solutions (e.g., direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, mineralization) Industrial ecology or chemical engineering principles Electricity generation and grid decarbonization strategies Ability to synthesize findings from scientific and technical reports. Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work independently with limited supervision when necessary. Excellent interpersonal skills and communication with internal teams and external stakeholders. Proficiency in Excel and/or analytical software (e.g., R, GIS, Tableau) preferred. We encourage candidates from diverse backgrounds to apply and look forward to welcoming an enthusiastic intern to our team! Benefits While we love our work, our lives aren’t defined by it.
