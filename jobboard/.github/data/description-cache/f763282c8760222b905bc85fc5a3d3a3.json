    "description": "&lt;p&gt;At Netflix, our mission is to entertain the world. Together, we are writing the next episode - pushing the boundaries of storytelling, global fandom and making the unimaginable a reality. We are a dream team obsessed with the uncomfortable excitement of discovering what happens when you merge creativity, intuition and cutting-edge technology. Come be a part of what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s no secret that we want to entertain the world. In order to do that we first must hire and develop the best people, starting with university students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a passion for solving challenging problems and learning how to build active and static protection to manage risk to talent and content creators, then we want to talk to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Content Operations &amp;amp; Innovation organization at Netflix supports content to thrill members with efficient operational workflows and execution while leveraging our scale and innovating to deliver more value on screen. Within this organization, we are looking to host one intern on the Content Security team, within Content Risk Management, during Summer 2026. The Content Security team works diligently to protect Netflix’s content across the pitch-to-play lifecycle. This means getting involved early to secure our creative output in the pre-production, production, and post-production phases, working with both our internal teams and our third party vendors across the creative ecosystem. We also work closely with our production and events security teams within Content Risk Management. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As an intern, you’ll assist in facilitating departmental needs and will participate in a program that provides training and development intended to give you the skill set necessary to become a strong candidate for future entry-level positions in Content Security. You will also gain experience in working closely with our Production, Talent, and Events Security team giving you robust exposure to all the ways in which Netflix secures its content - both physically and digitally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You do not need prior experience to apply; once you submit your application, you’ll receive an email inviting you to complete your application by filling out an Airtable form. You’ll also be asked to submit a 300-word-maximum statement of intent (preferably in PDF format) within the form using the following prompt: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Content Security team identifies and mitigates the security risk to our content across the pitch-to-play lifecycle. We collaborate with content creators, productions, post-production vendors, security professionals, and our internal creative and engineering teams to successfully protect our Content. Tell us why you are specifically interested in learning more about Content Security, including why protecting content creation appeals to you personally and what you hope to get out of this experience.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This posting will be open for a very limited time and will be closed for new applications by February 6, so if you’re interested, please submit your application as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are currently pursuing an undergraduate degree with authorization to work in the USA and an expected graduation date between December 2026 and May/June 2027.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You have a strong interest in exploring content security, particularly at the intersection of modern cybersecurity and film/television production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are open to residing in the Los Angeles area for the duration of the internship. If applicable, we provide relocation and housing support to help make this opportunity accessible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You have a basic understanding of computers and are familiar with software applications such as Google Suite (e.g., Gmail, Docs, Sheets) and Microsoft Office (e.g., Word, Excel).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments and feel empowered to contribute your ideas and skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are motivated, proactive, and comfortable working independently while taking initiative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are detail-oriented, exercise sound judgment, and are eager to learn and grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are curious about technology, production workflows, and are excited to expand your knowledge in these areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can handle sensitive information with confidentiality and discretion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Having a valid driver’s license and access to personal transportation are strongly suggested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What might you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Support the Content Security team in their day-to-day operations and gain hands-on experience in the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explore and become proficient in Netflix tools while immersing yourself in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jobs.netflix.com/culture&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Netflix culture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Observe how the Content Security team collaborates with Production, Talent, and Event Security, including opportunities to visit productions and participate in Event Security operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Build meaningful relationships with cross-functional teams across the organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attend insightful lectures hosted by industry professionals to deepen your understanding of the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contribute to departmental special events and projects, bringing your perspective and creativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Provide logistical support, including completing office runs when needed, as part of understanding the operational aspects of the team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gain insights into the value and impact of PR/Marketing campaigns and how they align with Content Security goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learn how risk assessment can influence marketing and communications strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Understand how protecting and securing Netflix content supports talent relations and drives business success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Travel regionally (within the U.S.) to Netflix events and contribute to on-site operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Summer Internship&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At Netflix, we offer a personalized experience for interns, and our aim is to offer an experience that mimics what it is like to actually work here.
