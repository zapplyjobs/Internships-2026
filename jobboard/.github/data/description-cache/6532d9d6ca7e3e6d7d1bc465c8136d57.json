    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role Anthropic is seeking an experienced Infrastructure Engineer to join our Sandboxing team within the Research organization. In this role, you'll build and scale the systems that enable researchers to safely execute and experiment with AI-generated code and interactions in isolated environments. As our models become more capable, the infrastructure supporting secure execution environments becomes increasingly critical. You'll work on distributed systems that must operate reliably at significant scale while maintaining strong security boundaries. Your work will directly support Anthropic's mission to develop AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and trustworthy. Responsibilities Design, build, and operate distributed backend systems that power secure sandboxed execution environments Scale infrastructure to meet growing research and product demands while maintaining reliability and performance Implement and maintain serverless architectures and container orchestration systems Collaborate with research teams to understand requirements and translate them into robust infrastructure solutions Develop monitoring, alerting, and observability systems to ensure operational excellence Participate in on-call rotations and incident response to maintain system reliability Contribute to infrastructure automation and tooling that improves developer productivity Partner with security teams to ensure sandboxing infrastructure maintains appropriate isolation guarantees You may be a good fit if you Have 5+ years of experience building and operating backend infrastructure at scale Have deep expertise in distributed systems design and implementation Have strong operational experience, including debugging complex production issues Are proficient with cloud platforms, particularly GCP/GCS (experience with AWS or Azure is also valuable) Have experience with containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes) and understand their security implications Are comfortable working with infrastructure as code and modern DevOps practices Have strong programming skills in languages such as Python, Go, or Rust Are results-oriented with a bias towards flexibility and impact Care about the societal impacts of your work and are motivated by Anthropic's mission Strong candidates may also have experience with Serverless architectures and functions-as-a-service platforms (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Lambda) Designing and implementing secure multi-tenant systems High-performance computing environments or ML infrastructure Linux systems internals, including namespaces, cgroups, and seccomp Network security and isolation techniques Building systems that support research workflows and rapid iteration The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
