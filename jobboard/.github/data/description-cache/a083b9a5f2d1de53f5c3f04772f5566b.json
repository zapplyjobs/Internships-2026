    "description": "Brookhaven National Laboratory is committed to employee success and we believe that a comprehensive employee benefits program is an important and meaningful part of the compensation employees receive. Review more information at BNL | Benefits ProgramOrganization Overview:The Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) at Brookhaven is a DOE-funded national scientific user facility, offering users a supported research experience with top-caliber scientists and access to state-of-the- art instrumentation. The CFN mission is advancing nanoscience through frontier fundamental research and technique development and is the nexus of a broad collaboration network. Each year, CFN staff members support the research of nearly 600 external facility users.Three strategic nanoscience themes underlie the CFN scientific facilities: The CFN conducts research on nanomaterial synthesis by assembly designing precise architectures with targeted functionality by organizing nanoscale components. The CFN researches and applies platforms for state-of-the-art techniques for Accelerated Nanomaterial Discovery, integrating synthesis, advanced characterization, physical modeling, and computer science to iteratively explore a wide range of material parameters. The CFN develops and utilizes advanced capabilities for studies of Nanomaterials in Operando Conditions for characterizing materials and reactions at the atomic scale in real-world environments.This project will focus on developing a web user interface (UI), LightshowAI, for AI-driven core-level spectroscopy data analysis. In particular, LightshowAI integrates a 3D structure visualizer, a spectral visualizer and a spectral prediction AI that allows users to perform comprehensive, interactive analysis tasks. In this position, you will implement interactive features of modeling, visualization and analysis on LightshowAI and demonstrate core utilities using both simulation and experimental data.-This is a 6-month Term Appointment-Essential Duties and Responsibilities:You will develop a user friendly and easy-to-use web UI.You will implement core features of file I/O, visualization and analysis.You will write manual for core features.You will prepare tutorials to demonstrate the utilities of LightshowAI to users.Required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:Must be a college or graduate student enrolled in computer science related or STEM field.You need strong skills in web design and programing with java script, html, dash / native react or python, or other related techniques.You communicate effectively, both verbally and in writing.You are committed to fostering an environment of safe scientific work practices.Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:You have demonstrated track record in web design through open-source project or publicly available websites.You have demonstrated knowledge in physics or materials science.You have demonstrated knowledge of machine learning methods.You can work effectively in a collaborative team to tackle challenging problems, such as understanding complex scientific data.Other Information:Temporary/Part-time schedule of 19 hours per week (Monday - Friday).6 month term.Brookhaven National Laboratory requires all non-badged personnel including visitors to produce a REAL-ID or REAL-ID compliant documentation to access Brookhaven National Laboratory – view more information at www.bnl.gov/real-id.  This is due to nationwide identification requirements for federal site access as required by the federal REAL ID Act.  Those not in possession of a REAL ID-compliant document will not be permitted to access the site which includes access to the Laboratory for interviews. About UsBrookhaven National Laboratory (www.bnl.gov) delivers discovery science and transformative technology to power and secure the nation’s future. Brookhaven Lab is a multidisciplinary laboratory with seven Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, 37 R&D 100 Awards, and more than 70 years of pioneering research. The Lab is primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science. Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA) operates and manages the Laboratory for DOE. BSA is a partnership between Battelle and The Research Foundation for the State University of New York on behalf of Stony Brook University.
