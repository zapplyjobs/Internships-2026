Learn more about us on our YouTube Channel or Blog PostsWho You AreYou are a senior marketing leader with strong judgment, deep growth instincts, and a creative edge. You understand how creative, brand, and technical marketing execution can either accelerate growth or quietly limit it and you know how to align these functions without turning marketing into a bottleneck.Earlier in your career, you were hands-on across acquisition, funnels, lifecycle marketing, paid media, and conversion optimization. You bring that practitioner mindset into your leadership today, enabling you to quickly assess execution quality, identify gaps, and raise the bar without micromanaging.You are a creative thinker who values experimentation and learning. You are comfortable challenging safe or recycled ideas, encouraging bold but thoughtful testing, and using results whether wins or misses to inform better growth decisions. You lead through clarity, accountability, and sound judgment, and you enjoy working with strong marketers who are leaders in their own right.What Success Looks LikePhase I: Diagnose & Establish LeverageYou quickly develop a deep, end-to-end understanding of the growth engine across paid acquisition, creative, funnels, lifecycle, and marketing operations. You clearly identify where performance is strong, where spend or effort is leaking, where systems are slowing momentum, and where the organization is playing it too safe. You form a clear point of view on the highest-leverage opportunities across paid media, creative direction, and lifecycle strategy.Phase II: Sharpen Strategy & Drive MomentumMarketing strategy becomes sharper and more focused across acquisition, creative, lifecycle, and operations. You actively drive changes to priorities, spend allocation, creative direction, and experimentation approach.Teams operate with a consistent experimentation rhythm, clearer signal, and faster feedback loops. Brand and direct-response marketing are intentionally aligned, and teams are oriented around outcomes, ownership, and learning rather than activity.Phase III: Scale Results & Build DurabilityYou build a scalable marketing organization that consistently drives growth without constant intervention. Winning strategies are scaled with discipline, leadership depth is established across functions, and experimentation is institutionalized so innovation is repeatable, not episodic.Teams are empowered to make strong decisions independently while staying aligned to strategy, allowing the marketing organization to compound results rather than rely on heroics.What You’ll Be DoingOwn the strategy for driving traffic, trials, and downstream revenue across the funnelDefine acquisition strategy, traffic mix, funnel structure, offers, promotions, launches, and growth initiativesProvide strategic input into lifecycle and early retention efforts to improve conversion and long-term revenue impactOwn performance marketing strategy across all paid acquisition channels, including budgets and scaling decisionsEnsure creative and technical execution aligns tightly with growth strategy and revenue outcomes.Creative & Experimental GrowthPush the organization beyond safe, incremental marketing approachesEncourage bold, data-informed experimentation across acquisition channels, creative, and offersPressure-test ideas before launch and help teams refine concepts prior to executionTurn successful experiments into repeatable, scalable systemsStep in to help lead strategy shifts when growth plateaus or new opportunities emergePerformance, Measurement & LearningDefine success metrics tied to trials, revenue, efficiency, and learningHold teams accountable for paid media performance, experimentation quality, and scaling outcomesEnsure decisions are grounded in data rather than opinions, balancing speed with rigorUnderstand attribution tradeoffs and lifecycle impact across channelsRegularly review performance data to surface insights and ask the questions others may overlookMarketing Operations, Creative & Technical ExecutionOversee Marketing Operations and its leadershipPartner closely with Technical Marketing teams responsible for funnels, landing pages, automation, tracking, and infrastructurePartner with Creative teams responsible for brand, design, video, and marketing assets across direct response and corporate marketingSet clear standards for what great execution looks like across creative and technical workEnsure brand and direct-response marketing reinforce one anotherBalance speed, quality, and learning so systems support experimentation rather than slow it downLeadership & Team DevelopmentLead and develop Directors, Managers, and senior individual contributors across marketing functionsHire and grow future leaders as the organization scalesSet a high bar for ownership, thinking, and executionBuild a culture of trust, accountability, experimentation, and strong outcomesWhat You’ll BringBachelor’s degree in Marketing, Business, or a related field (Master’s preferred) or equivalent experience15+ years of experience in marketing or growth, including 7+ years leading teams and managing budgets at scaleMeaningful experience leading growth- or revenue-focused marketing teams in high-growth environmentsDeep expertise in performance marketing, funnels, direct response, conversion psychology, and paid acquisitionStrong judgment, curiosity, and a bias toward action and resultsAbility to operate effectively in ambiguous environments with clear accountabilityWhy Join HighLevel?High-growth company with a devoted user base and a huge market opportunity.A unique chance to shape not just product marketing, but also education and certification strategy.Collaborative team culture.Smart, passionate colleagues and room to leadThe salary range for this position is $203000 - $325000 annually (Bonus Pay included)Equal Employment Opportunity InformationThe company is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
