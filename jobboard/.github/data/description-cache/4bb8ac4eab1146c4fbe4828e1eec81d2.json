Founded in 1972, InterDigital is listed on Nasdaq. InterDigital is a registered trademark of InterDigital, Inc.The Wireless Research group within InterDigital’s Research and Innovation (R&I) organization is responsible for leading InterDigital’s North American next generation wireless research projects. Our charter is to identify future technology needs, develop and learn from proof-of-concept prototypes, and innovate around a system focus. Today this team is at the leading edge of 6G research. One of our current research themes focuses on Information Value-Native and Reasoning-Based Semantic Wireless Systems, with a vision for future artificial general intelligence native networks.The evolution of communication services beyond connectivity-only based service opens up opportunity to redesign the communication system for dynamic fine-grain adjustment of QoS treatment and provide per-packet treatment leveraging advanced AI/ML capabilities. The goal of this research project is to develop the scientific foundations for: a) information-value metrics that include attributes beyond connectivity and their integration into the evaluation of user experience,  b) design of new communication, artificial intelligence (AI), and computing architectures that are tailored towards delivering target QoE while factoring in the information value and reasoning-based semantic, and 3) development of novel protocols that can enable information value-centric operation of wireless systems.We are seeking a highly motivated wireless engineering intern to work on this project and help design, simulate, and prototype novel solutions, in which intelligent networks self-optimize to deliver services to users and devices that are tailored to content, context, connectivity, and beyond connectivity services.Essential Duties and ResponsibilitiesCarry out cutting-edge research in radio interface design including physical layer, radio interface architecture and L2-4  protocols for next generation mobile communications systemsResearch, analyze and evaluate cellular systems and develop wireless protocols and algorithm designs using theoretical analysis, link-level, or system-level simulations for 6G and beyondImplement wireless protocols and associated algorithms in a MATLAB or Sionna based testbench to support various features for 6G and beyondPrepare technical reports, presentations, and/or technical papers surveying state of the art, describing design and development efforts, and presenting evaluation resultsDrive technology generation and disclosure writing and supporting patent applications and downstream supportQualificationsPh.D. student in Electrical Engineering or related fieldStrong analytical and research skills.
