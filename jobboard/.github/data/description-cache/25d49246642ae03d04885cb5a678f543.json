    "description": "WHY JOIN ALO? Mindful movement. It’s at the core of why we do what we do at ALO—it’s our calling. Because mindful movement in the studio leads to better living. It changes who yogis are off the mat, making their lives and their communities better. That’s the real meaning of studio-to-street: taking the consciousness from practice on the mat and putting it into practice in life.ALO brings together mindfulness, movement, and modern technology. Our retail experiences are thoughtfully designed, from studio to store to digital touchpoints, and powered by systems that must be as elegant as they are resilient. As an intern at ALO, you won’t be observing the sidelines. You’ll help build technology that directly shapes how guests experience the brand every day. Here, innovation is rooted in purpose, craftsmanship, and impact. OVERVIEW At ALO, retail is more than a transaction—it’s an experience grounded in intention, movement, and connection. As a Retail Engineering Summer Intern, you’ll help build the technology that powers seamless in-store and omni-channel experiences for both customers and store associates.
