    "description": "Life at UiPath The people at UiPath believe in the transformative power of automation to change how the world works. We’re committed to creating category-leading enterprise software that unleashes that power. To make that happen, we need people who are curious, self-propelled, generous, and genuine. People who love being part of a fast-moving, fast-thinking growth company. And people who care—about each other, about UiPath, and about our larger purpose. Could that be you? Join our summer Engineering Intern program in Bellevue, WA! Join UiPath, where we are at the forefront of combining automation and AI to accelerate human achievement. We are building the future of intelligent automation through agentic automation, creating agents that handle complex tasks autonomously. As an AI Engineer Intern, you will contribute to core components of our platform, with a focus on developing capabilities like Context Grounding, Conversational Agents, and Agent Memory. These essential services provide the foundation for our AI Agents to understand and interact effectively with enterprise data and applications. What you’ll do at UiPath: Contribute to the design, development, and operation of AI-driven components within the UiPath platform. Assist in the implementation of features and systems related to our AI services. Collaborate with senior engineers to ensure software deliverables meet high standards of quality and performance. Engage with and learn engineering best practices, including CI/CD, testing, and operational excellence. Stay current with emerging technologies in AI and Generative AI. Work closely with product managers, UX designers, and other engineers to understand and contribute to the technical product roadmap. Participate in addressing customer tickets and begin to form a perspective on customer pain points. Understand key customer scenarios and help automate them through testing. What you’ll bring to the team: A PhD degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, or a related technical field. Up to 1 year of software engineering experience through internships, research, or coursework. A foundational understanding of Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, with exposure to Large Language Models (LLM) or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being highly valuable. Strong proficiency in programming languages such as Python (especially with AI/ML frameworks), TypeScript, or C#. A solid grasp of object-oriented programming principles and computer science fundamentals, including data structures and algorithms. An understanding of API design (REST, gRPC) and asynchronous programming concepts. An ability to work effectively within a globally distributed team. Excellent communication skills and the ability to articulate technical concepts. A willingness to seek feedback and apply best practices to improve performance. #LI-RW1 Maybe you don’t tick all the boxes above—but still think you’d be great for the job? Go ahead, apply anyway.
