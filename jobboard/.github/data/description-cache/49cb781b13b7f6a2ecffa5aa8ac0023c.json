    "description": "Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform: play video games. Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming.

Our Notifications team plays a critical role in that connection — helping users stay engaged with the conversations and communities they care about, even when they're away from Discord.
