    "description": "About Air Space Intelligence ASI's mission-critical technology powers decision-making across aviation, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure domains. Backed by top-tier investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital, and Renegade Partners, ASI delivers operational decision superiority—compressing days of analysis into seconds of action. ASI is leading the way and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. What you will do: As a Software Engineer in our Co-Op program, you will work alongside seasoned software engineers to build ASI’s Department of War products. Our engineers do it all, from meeting with customers to solving complex distributed systems problems. We do whatever it takes to solve our users’ most urgent needs. You will learn how to distill product requirements, write design docs, and build complex software, shoulder to shoulder with the best engineers in the industry. Our previous Co-Ops have built mission-critical features, such as detecting when planes are diverted or alerting when a scheduled route is expected to hit turbulence. What we value: Passionate Builders - We’re looking for talented engineers who love to build. Building isn’t a job, it’s a lifestyle. Our stack includes Python, Rust, and React — whether you already know them or are eager to learn, you’ll thrive if you love solving hard problems and shipping great products. Fast Learners - We don’t expect you to do it all day one, but we do expect that you love to learn and learn quickly. At ASI, speed matters. Critical Thinkers - The world is rapidly changing, and as a result, we must continuously reinvent ourselves to stay ahead and relevant. We love divergent thinkers and people who will come in and challenge the status quo. Force Multipliers - Being excellent in a silo is only part of the equation - to thrive at ASI is to be collaborative and positive-sum oriented. Futurists - You’re energized by the fact that software engineering is being redefined in real time. You seek out new tools and paradigms, including AI, and use them deliberately to compound your impact — without sacrificing technical depth, ownership or taste. How do we hire: To apply, simply fill out the application and be sure to answer all questions! We look at the interview process not as a screening or test, but rather as an opportunity to simulate what it would look like working together. We build the interview process around you.",
