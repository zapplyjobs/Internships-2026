    "description": "The Aerospace Corporation is the trusted partner to the nation’s space programs, solving the hardest problems and providing unmatched technical expertise. As the operator of a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), we are broadly engaged across all aspects of space— delivering innovative solutions that span satellite, launch, ground, and cyber systems for defense, civil and commercial customers. When you join our team, you’ll be part of a special collection of problem solvers, thought leaders, and innovators. Join us and take your place in space.Physical Sciences Laboratories (PSL) supports the effective and timely development and operation of national security systems through scientific research and the application of advanced technologies. PSL has more than 150 specialized laboratories used to test, analyze, and troubleshoot virtually every aspect of rocket and satellite system design, development, construction, deployment, and operation. The expertise of the laboratories’ technical staff allows PSL to stay abreast of new technological developments and program support issues associated with rapidly evolving space systems. The Atomic Clocks & Device Physics Section in PSL is involved in a broad range of both basic and applied precise-timekeeping activities: from Monte Carlo simulations of space-timekeeping architectures to the development of next-generation space clocks, from engineering studies of low-temperature inductively-coupled-plasmas for atomic signal generation to basic physics experiments elucidating processes affecting next-generation space-clock performance.  The successful applicant can expect to work closely with atomic clock scientists investigating these issues, and can expect to work somewhat independently helping to move the efforts forward.The selected candidate will be required to work full-time, on-site at our facility in El Segundo, CA.What You’ll Be Doing Supporting laboratory research and data analysis in (for example) optoelectronic materials and devices, optical signal processing, experiment automation and atomic clock development.Participating on interdisciplinary teams related to ongoing research projects.Applying standard laboratory techniques and procedures to carry out a series of prescribed scientific and/or engineering tasks.Duties, responsibilities and activities may change, or new ones may be assigned as needed Training and mentorship will be provided What Corporate Skills You’ll Bring Strong written and oral communication skills Must work well in a team environment Possess organizational, time management and project management skills Demonstrate flexibility and ability to adapt to changing organizational need Interpersonal skills to coordinate efforts and work with other internal and external organizations What You Need to be Successful  Minimum Requirements: Currently enrolled full time in an accredited college/university program pursuing a Master's/PhD degree in Physics, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering or related discipline.Availability to work full-time for a minimum of 10 weeks outside of university term and ability to return to a Master's/PhD degree program full-time after completion of the internship.Undergraduate degree completed by internship start date.Working knowledge of Labview, Python or Matlab.This position requires ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance, which is issued by the US government.
