    "description": "Human Interactive Driving Intern, Human-Machine Interaction ResearchLos Altos, CAHuman Interactive Driving – Internships - Summer 2026 /Intern /HybridApply for this jobAt Toyota Research Institute (TRI), we’re on a mission to improve the quality of human life. We’re developing new tools and capabilities to amplify the human experience. To lead this transformative shift in mobility, we’ve built a world-class team advancing the state of the art in AI, robotics, driving, and material sciences. This internship opportunity is a paid 12-week internship for Summer 2026. Please note that this internship will be a hybrid in-office role.The MissionOur team uses design thinking process to place the human at the center of determining the needs, design, and implementation of human-machine interfaces. By following this process, the HMIR team creates automotive HMI technologies that allow humans of any ability to work in harmony with AI. The TeamIn the Human-Machine Interaction Research group (HMIR), we design, develop and evaluate novel interfaces to improve the safety, well-being, and performance of drivers using human-centered artificial intelligence. The InternshipAs a Research Intern, you will work on a project focused on improving driving safety and performance using the driver's behavioral, cognitive, and emotional states. There will be opportunities to design and run experiments in our driving motion simulator to study how different driver traits and states lead to unsafe driving behaviors, and how human-machine interfaces can be used to improve the driving experience. An ideal candidate should have experience running experiments with human subjects and should be pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, Psychology, Human Factors Engineering, or related fields. Experience with machine learning, measuring physiological signals (e.g., EDA, heart rate), and eye-tracking is a plus. You will work with a strong team of researchers, and the expected outcome is to have a publication at a human-computer interaction or cognitive science journal/conference.ResponsibilitiesConduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness and responses to different interventions to improve driving safety and performance.Create novel interventions that can be used to help people drive better and safer.Partner with a multidisciplinary team including other research scientists and engineers across Toyota Research Institute.Present results in verbal and written communications, both internally and at top international venues.QualificationsCurrently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, Psychology, Human Factors Engineering, or related fields.Experience designing and running experiments with human subjects.Past cross-functional collaboration with other researchers and engineers to invent and develop interesting research ideas.You are passionate about developing and applying human-centered artificial intelligence for social good.You are a reliable team player. You like to think big and go deeper. You care about openness and delivering with integrity.Experience with machine learning is a plus.Experience with devices to measure physiological signals is a plus (e.g., EDA, heart rate).Experience with eye-tracking devices is a plus.The pay range for this position at commencement of employment is expected to be between $45 and $65/hour for California-based roles.
