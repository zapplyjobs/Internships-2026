    "description": "Computational Materials Science InternFull-timeLegal Entity: Robert Bosch LLCCompany DescriptionThe Bosch Research and Technology Center North America with offices in Sunnyvale, California, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Watertown, Massachusetts is part of the global Bosch Group (www.bosch.com), a company with over 90 billion euro revenue, 400,000 people worldwide, a very diverse product portfolio, and a history of over 125 years. The Research and Technology Center North America (RTC-NA) is committed to providing technologies and system solutions for various Bosch business fields primarily in the areas of Human Machine Interaction (HMI), Robotics, Energy Technologies, Internet Technologies, Circuit Design, Semiconductors and Wireless, and MEMS Advanced Design.The Computational Materials Science team in Watertown specializes in atomistic and mesoscale simulation to improve Bosch products through deep understanding of thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport phenomena on an atomic level. Using quantum mechanical and classical simulations, and machine learning, our team focuses on application areas which include electrochemistry, energy conversion, sensors, and sustainability. Our work directly contributes to the development of innovative solutions for real-world challenges.Job DescriptionWe are seeking highly motivated and skilled interns for a 3-6 month internship in our Computational Materials Science team. The intern will focus on one or more of the following areas and will be expected to write reports, review literature, and prepare presentations of results for project team meetings.Key responsibilities:Development and application of atomistic and/or mesoscale methods for understanding thermodynamics, kinetics, degradation, and transport phenomenaComputational discovery and/or characterization of next-generation materials systemsDesigning and implementing code for high-performance and high-throughput computing, including machine-learning methodsAnticipated areas of interest for 2026 internships: Candidates are strongly encouraged to highlight relevant atomistic experience and projects of interest in their cover letters/resumes. Extra attention is paid to experience in the detailed comparison of simulation results or trends to experimental data.Phase transition and analysis of interfaces: thermodynamic/kinetics of solidification, nanoparticle growth, or gas phase condensation. Microkinetic modeling of chemical reactions: etching, corrosion, and thermal management. Surface contact under extreme conditions: Abrasion, wear, migration and stiction with large external fields. Mechanics of amorphous ceramics: surface residual stresses, crack propagation, stresses due to mismatched interfaces.Development of free-energy methods combining the throughput and flexibility of classical potentials and accuracy of DFT-based machine-learned interatomic potentials The ideal candidate has experience in quantitative simulations with one of these methods: Free energy analysis Transition state theory Microscopic phase field methods Gas hydrodynamics Molecular dynamics at phase interfaces (solid/liquid/gas) Learning and development opportunitiesInterns gain hands-on experience in industry research alongside experienced engineers and fellow interns. Past interns often complete one or more patents, software packages, or publications, as well as develop valuable skills in their careers. Approximately half of associates on our team are former interns, demonstrating a potential for long-term growth and opportunities.QualificationsRequired qualificationsCurrent PhD candidate at a top university in chemical engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science, or a related fieldExperience in running or interacting with atomistic-scale simulations, including at least one of: density-functional theory, molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry or phase-fieldSolid foundations in materials science, solid-state physics, and/or chemistryAttention to detail, flexibility, creativity, and excellent communication and teamwork skillsA cover letter describing why the candidate is suited for the position, past computational materials science experiences, and the desired project choice(s)Minimum GPA of 3.0Desired qualificationsSignificant research experience, including high-impact publications, patents, and/or contributions to open-source codesStrong background in physics and coding, and passion on working and understanding physics- and chemistry-based devicesPast experience directly comparing experimental measurements with computational materials science simulationsProven ability to design research objectives, conduct independent research, and develop expertise in a specific fieldPast experience relevant to one or more of the projects listedAdditional InformationThe U.S. base salary range for this intern position is $40.50-$59.00 per hour. Within the range, individual pay is determined based on several factors, including, but not limited to, type of degree, work experience and job knowledge, complexity of the role, type of position, job location, etc. Your Hiring Manager can share more details about the specific salary range for this position during the interview process.*All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.Job LocationGoogle Maps requires functional cookies to be enabledI'm interestedI'm interestedPrivacy PolicyImprint",
