    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the Role We are looking for Engineering Managers to join our Claude Experiences org to lead and grow teams of software engineers working on backend systems for Claude.ai, including our clients on the web, desktop, and mobile. You'll be responsible for defining and executing the creation of shared product capabilities at the core of Claude.ai while maintaining clear direction and stability for your team. This is a net-new team, initially seeded with a small number of tenured Claude.ai engineers. Historically, the design, development, and maintenance of our systems and infrastructure was a shared responsibility between our small group of Claude Experiences engineers, collaborating closely with our larger Platform and Infra organizations. We believe that there is an opportunity for a team to drive a lot of impact, both in our foundations and in the product, by focusing on backend systems specifically for Claude.ai. You'll partner closely with product managers, engineering leadership, research teams, and our inference, infrastructure, and platform teams to transform emerging AI capabilities into products that make AI collaboration feel effortless, pro-human, and essential to how work gets done. Success in this role requires a strong ability to understand stakeholder needs, identify opportunities to share capabilities across products, understand our product and roadmap deeply, and the ability to facilitate rapid iterations to improve our product suite. We both need to maintain high-quality systems for our existing product surfaces while collaborating closely with research to build products at the frontier of model capabilities. About Claude Experiences We are responsible for Claude.ai across the web, desktops, and mobile devices.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
