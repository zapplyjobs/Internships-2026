    "description": "Data Scientist, Ego and Ado Decision (Internship)Ann Arbor, MIInternship – AD/ADAS /Intern /HybridApply for this jobWoven by Toyota is enabling Toyota’s once-in-a-century transformation into a mobility company. Inspired by a legacy of innovating for the benefit of others, our mission is to challenge the current state of mobility through human-centric innovation — expanding what “mobility” means and how it serves society.Our work centers on four pillars: AD/ADAS, our autonomous driving and advanced driver assist technologies; Arene, our software development platform for software-defined vehicles; Woven City, a test course for mobility; and Cloud & AI, the digital infrastructure powering our collaborative foundation. Business-critical functions empower these teams to execute, and together, we’re working toward one bold goal: a world with zero accidents and enhanced well-being for all.TEAMAt Woven by Toyota, we tackle Autonomy challenges at the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Advanced Driving. Our work includes a diverse array of challenges and activities, such as analyzing petabytes of multimodal driving data, solving optimization problems in computer vision, minimizing latency on hardware accelerators, deploying scalable and efficient machine learning (ML) training and evaluation pipelines, and designing novel neural network architectures to advance state-of-the-art ML for Perception, Prediction, and Motion Planning. We are looking for doers and creative problem solvers to join us in improving mobility for everyone with human-centered automated driving solutions for personal and commercial applications.ML Behavior Planning Team’s goal is to develop and apply state of the art ML approaches to the motion planning of self driving vehicles. The team aims to significantly improve how vehicles are designed and developed, and we're working closely with Toyota to realize this goal in its next-generation vehicles.You will work as a team member in one of our teams. Our team develops ML solutions to enable deployment of software functionality across large fleets of vehicles. Our work includes a diverse array of challenges, among these analyzing petabytes of multimodal driving data plays a crucial role, as data is what we ultimately feed to the models we deploy in the vehicles. WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?The team is looking for a passionate Data Scientist Intern to join us in designing and developing frameworks and analytical tools that enable deep introspection of large-scale behavioral and motion‑related datasets, as well as creating effective methods for integrating labeled data into the team’s development pipeline. All this to directly support the experimentation of novel motion planning architectures and training paradigms, with the goal of improving the lives of millions of people driving Toyota vehicles every day. As an Intern, you will be working with a team of Data Scientists to develop an ML‑first approach to motion planning that combines the latest achievements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, motion planning, and robotics.WHAT WE'LL GIVE YOUThe areas in which the intern can expect to grow during the internship are two‑fold. First, they will have the opportunity to elevate their ability to design data‑driven system architectures for state‑of‑the‑art mobility and vehicle intelligence applications. The second aspect, being the opportunity to acquire hands-on capability in solving practical engineering problems in a real, product oriented, industry setup.Woven by Toyota internships are structured to ensure you grow both technically and professionally. You will get a chance to work on real projects that will impact future key results of our mission, while receiving constant feedback, and clear goals/directions. This is achieved by providing you support from both mentors, and managers, throughout your entire internship period. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to share and present the results of your project with the team, as well as others that may be interested in your achievements.MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONSMust be currently pursuing a master's or higher degree in a quantitative fields (e.g. Statistics, Mathematics, Physics)Development skills with Python and SQL data analysis libraries and packagesExperience in dealing with large-scale data science problemsExperience with theoretical aspects of data science and machine learning (deep learning, statistical analysis, and mathematical modeling)Experience in building machine learning algorithms and infrastructure, such as: data pre- and post-processing, sampling and curation, ablation studies, evaluationUnderstanding of ML workflow: preparing and sampling data, implementation and training of ML models, evaluating results, running ablation studiesNICE TO HAVESLeveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to derive data insightsExperience with PyTorch or other ML frameworksBuild or manage infrastructure, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub ActionsExperience with temporal/sequential and/or spatial dataExperience in self-driving challenges (Perception, Prediction, Mapping, Localization, Planning, Simulation).Experience with topics such as embeddings, clustering, anomaly detection, and similarity searchExperience with distributed and cloud computing/training platformsOur Commitment・We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity.・Any information we receive from you will be used only in the hiring and onboarding process.
