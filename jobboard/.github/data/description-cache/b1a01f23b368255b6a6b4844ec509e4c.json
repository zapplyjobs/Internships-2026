At our core, Western Digital is a company of problem solvers. People achieve extraordinary things given the right technology. For decades, we’ve been doing just that—our technology helped people put a man on the moon and capture the first-ever picture of a black hole. We offer an expansive portfolio of technologies, HDDs, and platforms for business, creative professionals, and consumers alike under our Western Digital®, WD®, WD_BLACK™, and SanDisk® Professional brands. We are a key partner to some of the largest and highest-growth organizations in the world. From enabling systems to make cities safer and more connected, to powering the data centers behind many of the world’s biggest companies and hyperscale cloud providers, to meeting the massive and ever-growing data storage needs of the AI era, Western Digital is fueling a brighter, smarter future. Today’s exceptional challenges require your unique skills. Together, we can build the future of data storage.Job DescriptionEssential Duties & ResponsibilitiesThis is a summer internship in Western Digital Research, a world-class research laboratory in San Jose, California with ~80 employees. Research activities in the lab focus on information storage, sensors, spintronics, superconducting devices, and AI memory/compute architectures. The materials team conducts experimental and computational research activity with the mission to develop novel materials for emerging technologies. The summer intern will take on a materials modeling project involving collaboration and sharing of insights with scientists across theory and experimental teams.This internship project will focus on spin-to-charge conversion in novel materials. The ability to efficiently convert between spin and charge currents is critical for future spintronic devices like SOT-MRAM or inverse spin Hall sensors. By combining strong spin-orbit coupling in crystals with specific symmetries, spin currents can be generated using the spin Hall effect or the Edelstein effect. For this project, the intern will use first principles approaches to (1) evaluate the role of spin-orbit interactions in the band structure of crystalline materials, (2) calculate intrinsic spin Hall conductivity and Rashba-Edelstein contributions to spin transport and accumulation, and (3) examine the impact of strain and dopants on band structures and spin current.QualificationsRequired:Current student pursuing a PhD in Physics, Electrical Engineering, Material Science, or Chemistry.Knowledge of atomistic, ab-initio computational modeling techniques such as density functional theory. Experience with first principles codes including Quantum Espresso, VASP, Questaal, and KKR-CPA approaches. Experience predicting charge and spin transport using Kubo formula, non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) approaches, or Boltzmann transport equation.Minimum of 3.0 GPADemonstrated ability to conduct a research project.Excellent computer and communication skills. High attention to detail. Strong work ethic.Preferred:Background in magnetism and magnetic materials.Familiarity with converting plane wave DFT calculations to light weight localized basis sets for post-processing (e.g. PAOFlow and Wannier90).Additional InformationWestern Digital is committed to providing equal opportunities to all applicants and employees and will not discriminate against any applicant or employee based on their race, color, ancestry, religion (including religious dress and grooming standards), sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, breastfeeding or related medical conditions), gender (including a person’s gender identity, gender expression, and gender-related appearance and behavior, whether or not stereotypically associated with the person’s assigned sex at birth), age, national origin, sexual orientation, medical condition, marital status (including domestic partnership status), physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, protected medical and family care leave, Civil Air Patrol status, military and veteran status, or other legally protected characteristics.
