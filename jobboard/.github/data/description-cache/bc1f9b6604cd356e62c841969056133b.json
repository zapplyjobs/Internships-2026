    "description": "2026 Summer Intern - AIBT/TRAILDepartment SummaryThe Translational AI & Learning (TRAIL) group sits within Genentech’s AI for Biology & Translation (AIBT) department. AIBT develops and applies cutting-edge machine learning to decode complex biology, connect molecular data to human disease, and enable therapeutic impact. Our work spans modern foundation-model approaches, causal and predictive modeling, and real-world deployment in partnership with experimental and translational teams.Interns in TRAIL work closely with scientists and engineers across computational biology, statistics, and ML engineering to deliver methods that are scientifically rigorous, scalable, and grounded in real biomedical problems.Internship OverviewWe are seeking a highly motivated graduate student intern to join TRAIL for Summer 2026. The intern will contribute to an active research project at the intersection of machine learning and translational biology, with opportunities to develop new modeling approaches, analyze high-dimensional biological data, and evaluate methods in realistic settings.This internship is designed for candidates who enjoy owning a problem end-to-end—from formulating the question, to implementing models, to running careful evaluation, to communicating results clearly.Projects may include:Predictive modeling of disease-relevant phenotypes from multi-modal biological dataBenchmarking and evaluation frameworks for biological ML modelsTranslational applications of foundation models for complex disease biologyBuilding interpretable ML approaches to support target discovery and prioritization This Internship is located in South San Francisco On Site.The OpportunityDevelop and implement machine learning models to address a defined translational biology problem using large-scale genomics datasets.Design rigorous benchmarking and evaluation experiments (metrics, baselines, ablations) to assess model performance and generalization.Curate, preprocess, and analyze high-dimensional biological data (e.g., single-cell and multi-modal datasets) to support modeling and interpretation.Collaborate closely with computational and experimental partners to translate scientific questions into actionable modeling approaches and deliverables.Communicate results clearly through well-documented code, concise summaries, and a final presentation to the broader team.Program HighlightsIntensive 12-week, full-time (40 hours/week) paid internshipProgram start dates are in May or June 2026A stipend (based on location) will be provided to help alleviate costs associated with the internship. Ownership of challenging and impactful business-critical projects.Work with some of the most talented people in the biotechnology industry.Who You AreRequired EducationMust be pursuing a PhD (enrolled student)Required MajorsComputer Science, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Statistics, Data Science, Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, or related quantitative fieldRequired SkillsStrong programming skills in Python (experience with ML/data analysis workflows).Prior research experience in ML/AI, computational biology, genomics, or related domain (academic or industry).Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and QualificationsExperience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch preferred; TensorFlow ok)Familiarity with genomics / sequence modeling (e.g., DNA/RNA, regulatory genomics, variant effects)Experience working with large-scale datasets and reproducible workflowsRelocation benefits are not available for this job posting. The expected salary range for this position based on the primary location of the state of California is $50.00 per hour.  Actual pay will be determined based on experience, qualifications, geographic location, and other job-related factors permitted by law.
