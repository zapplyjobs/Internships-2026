    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role Anthropic is dedicated to developing AI assistants that are helpful, harmless, and honest. As usage of our AI services grows, we need to ensure they are not misused. The Safeguards team is at the forefront of protecting our users from the risks of powerful AIs as well as ethical, technical, and social risks from the use of generative AI. The Safeguards team at Anthropic builds protections for new AI features enabled by the research teams and protects new products and surfaces developed by our product teams. As a Product Manager for the Safeguards team at Anthropic, you will own the ideation, design, development and deployment of Safeguards systems and relevant product UX to ensure we are advancing frontier models safely to users across various cloud platforms. You will work closely with our research and product teams to develop detections, evals, interventions, and tools to measure and mitigate deployment and user risks. We are looking for a product manager who is deeply committed to making AI safe and beneficial for humanity. You are aware of the risks and are committed to working with experts and coming up with ideas for Anthropic to implement. You have deep technical expertise in development, deployment and measurement of Safeguards systems. You thrive in rapidly moving and ambiguous environments. Responsibilities: Determine how to build in safety by design upstream and leverage downstream defenses for Anthropic’s frontier models, AI products, customers on different surfaces - Claude.ai, 1P API, external Cloud providers. Ability to write safety evals and communicate externally about safety. Drive impact via ruthless prioritization by clearly defining problems, solution options forward, clarity on both business & technical tradeoffs and accordingly clear requirements toward MVP vs. ideal state. Align & collaborate with policy, enforcement, research, engineering and cross functional stakeholders. Understand the AI landscape and ecosystem to plan for mitigation of deployment risks of increasingly powerful models and determined adversaries. Lead the development of metrics to understand the area, performance, blindspots to help inform future project planning. You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years in product management with a focus on fast problem understanding, building roadmaps with tractable progress, ability to get into the details on data, detection & interventions, infrastructure & tools, and/or evals. Ability to make technical tradeoff decisions; ideally with experience working across policy experts, AI/ML research engineers and software engineering teams to design and build state of the art safety systems. Strong user understanding of how our products are used, their Safeguards concerns and how we provide the best solutions. Demonstrated ability to build product and engineering strategy across multiple cross-functional teams for a rapidly changing space. Demonstrated experience in designing and building metrics to evaluate risks, system performance, user impact and making crisp tradeoffs Very strong ability to navigate, and prioritize amidst rapidly changing product specs, and to flex into different domains to bring clarity and execute. Evidence of exercising judgment and decision making in ambiguous situations. Planning, building, launching and measuring new products / systems in a zero to one environment. Ability to clearly articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences in written and verbal communication. Think creatively about the risks and benefits of new technologies, and think beyond past checklists and playbooks. The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$305,000 - $385,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
