    "description": "About the teamAt Zoom, we're redefining how AI bridges Communications to Completions. We are the Responsible AI Team, dedicated to ensuring that advanced AI systems are safe, reliable, and aligned with human values. Our mission is to pioneer research and develop practical solutions that make AI systems trustworthy, controllable, and beneficial for society.What you can expectWe are seeking exceptional PhD students to join our team as Research Interns. You will work on cutting-edge research to ensure the safety, reliability, and alignment of the world's most advanced AI systems. This internship offers the opportunity to actively contribute to both foundational research and real-world product impact. Research Focus AreasAs an intern, you will contribute to one or more of the following interconnected research areas:1. AI Agent System Quality Evaluation & BenchmarkingDesign and develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks and benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI systems, including agentic AI and foundation modelsCreate novel metrics and methodologies to assess AI system capabilities, safety, and reliabilityBuild datasets and benchmarks for quality evaluation across diverse scenarios and modalities2. Controllable & Aligned AIResearch methods to ensure AI systems remain controllable and aligned with human intentions and valuesDevelop techniques for robustness, interpretability, controllability, and ethicality (RICE principles)Explore alignment training approaches including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methodologiesInvestigate methods to prevent agentic misalignment in autonomous AI systems3. Red Teaming & Adversarial RobustnessDesign and execute adversarial testing strategies to identify vulnerabilities in AI systemsDevelop automated red teaming tools and frameworks to stress-test model safety controlsResearch novel attack vectors including prompt injection, jailbreaking, and multimodal adversarial inputsContribute to identifying failure modes in both adversarial and benign user scenarios4. AI Guardrail Solutions & Defense SystemsBuild robust guardrail systems to defend against adversarial attacks and harmful outputsDevelop runtime monitoring and content moderation solutionsCreate self-improving security systems that anticipate evolving threatsResearch defense-in-depth strategies for comprehensive AI safetyWhat we're looking for Required:Currently enrolled in a PhD program in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, or a related technical fieldHave programming skills in Python and experience with ML frameworks (PyTorch, Huggingface, vLLM, SGLang)Possess a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and/or NLPDemonstrate ability to conduct independent researchHave strong written and verbal communication skillsPreferred:Have publications in top-tier venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, FAccT, AIES, or similar)Have prior research experience in AI safety, alignment, red teaming, adversarial robustness, or evaluationHave experience with large language models (LLMs) or generative AI systemsHave familiarity with RLHF, constitutional AI, or other alignment methodologiesHave previous internship experience in ML/AI researchWhat You'll GainHands-on experience benchmarking and securing world-class AI systemsMentorship from leading researchers in Responsible AIOpportunity to publish state-of-the-art research and contribute to open-source projectsCollaborative environment working with cross-functional teamsDirect impact on making AI safer for everyoneSalary Range or On Target Earnings:Minimum:$66.50Maximum:$106.50In addition to the base salary and/or OTE listed Zoom has a Total Direct Compensation philosophy that takes into consideration; base salary, bonus and equity value.Note: Starting pay will be based on a number of factors and commensurate with qualifications & experience.We also have a location based compensation structure;  there may be a different range for candidates in this and other locations.Ways of WorkingOur structured hybrid approach is centered around our offices and remote work environments.
