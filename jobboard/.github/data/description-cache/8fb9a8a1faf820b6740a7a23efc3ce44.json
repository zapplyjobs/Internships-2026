    "description": "Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform: play video games. Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming.

We're looking for a Senior Detection and Response Engineer to join our Detection & Response Team (DART). We're an engineering-focused team that build scalable detection systems, automate response workflows, and develop tooling that lets us stay ahead of threats rather than just react to them.

Design and implement detections across cloud infrastructure, applications, and enterprise systems using large-scale log analysis and behavioral signals. Engineer response automation. Develop tooling and workflows that reduce mean time to detection and response - turning manual playbooks into code. Lead incident response. Serve as a subject matter expert during security incidents, driving investigations from initial triage through root cause analysis and remediation. Architect observability. Partner with internal teams to identify new telemetry sources, improve log coverage, and ensure we have visibility where it matters. Hunt proactively.
