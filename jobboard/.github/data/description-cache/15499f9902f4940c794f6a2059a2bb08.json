    "description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About the Role: CI/CD is the beating heart of Vercel. Whether you’re previewing a new idea from v0 or shipping the next great thing to production, every customer builds — and millions of builds flow through our systems every day. As a Senior Infrastructure Engineer on the CI/CD team, you’ll take ownership of the systems that power these builds at scale. You won’t just contribute features — you’ll be responsible for the design, reliability, and evolution of the platform itself. You’ll make decisions that shape performance, define best practices, and ensure the developer workflows that Vercel and our customers depend on are fast, resilient, and secure. This role blends product thinking with deep systems ownership. You’ll partner with teams across Vercel to build and operate infrastructure that directly impacts how developers ship software on the web.

Design and operate high-performance microservices that process millions of builds daily, ensuring speed, reliability, and developer delight. Lead projects end-to-end: from identifying opportunities to defining technical direction and delivering improvements in performance, reliability, and developer experience. Collaborate across teams to align infrastructure with company-wide goals and ensure seamless developer workflows. Shape the long-term vision of CI/CD at Vercel by setting standards for scalability, reliability, and developer productivity. Participate in the on-call rotation, taking responsibility for the reliability of critical systems. Contribute to the open-source community, representing Vercel’s commitment to advancing developer tools globally. Write clean, efficient, tested, and well-documented code that others can build upon confidently.

Strong proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, with the ability to navigate and improve complex systems. Strong proficiency with cloud infrastructure (AWS) and infrastructure as code (Terraform) A track record of end-to-end ownership — from design and implementation through to long-term operation in production.
