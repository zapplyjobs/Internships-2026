    "description": "Who We Are: Bandwidth, a prior “Best of EC” award winner, is a global software company that helps enterprises deliver exceptional experiences through voice, messaging, and emergency services. Reaching 65+ countries and over 90 percent of the global economy, we're the only provider offering an owned communications cloud that delivers advanced automation, AI integrations, global reach, and premium human support. Bandwidth is trusted for mission-critical communications by the Global 2000, hyperscalers, and SaaS builders! At Bandwidth, your music matters when you are part of the BAND. We celebrate differences and encourage BANDmates to be their authentic selves. #jointheband What We Are Looking For: Bandwidth's Research & Development (R&D) team is at the forefront of exploring and harnessing transformative technologies to define the next generation of communication experiences. We operate as a small, agile, and T-shaped group, diving deep into emerging areas like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. We're seeking a highly motivated R&D Intern to join this dynamic team in our Raleigh, NC headquarters for Summer 2026! You thrive in a collaborative, fast-paced environment where you can rapidly iterate on ideas and prototypes. You have a startup mentality, comfortable with ambiguity and driven by a relentless curiosity to explore, build, and learn. If you're passionate about applying cutting-edge AI/ML, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), to solve real-world problems and shape future products, this is the role for you. What You'll Do: Dive deep into the latest AI/ML research, particularly in the LLM space, identifying opportunities relevant to Bandwidth's domain. Design, build, and test proof-of-concepts and prototypes for novel AI-powered features and services. Implement and integrate AI/ML models, including those based on LLMs, into potential future Bandwidth offerings. Collaborate intensely within a small, cross-functional R&D team, sharing knowledge and contributing to a T-shaped skill set. Experiment with various AI techniques, including advanced prompting strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and potentially agentic systems. Stay constantly updated on the rapidly evolving AI landscape, evaluating new tools, models, and methodologies. Leverage LLM-powered IDEs and development tools (like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to accelerate the innovation cycle. Clearly articulate and present research findings, experiment results, and prototype demonstrations to technical and non-technical stakeholders. What You Need: Must be actively pursuing a Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree, or PhD program in Computer Science, AI, ML, or other similar technical field Demonstrable expertise and hands-on experience in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with deep knowledge in at least one specific AI domain (e.g., NLP, LLMs, Speech Recognition). Experience designing, building, and evaluating AI/ML models and systems. Strong programming skills, particularly in Python and familiarity with common ML libraries/frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face). Proven ability to thrive in a small, highly collaborative team environment with an urgent, results-oriented culture. A relentless curiosity and passion for exploring new technologies and techniques in the AI/ML space. Experience using LLM-powered IDEs or coding assistants. Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to navigate ambiguity. Must be able to work from the Bandwidth headquarters in Raleigh, NC. Bonus Points: Significant experience in startups or similar fast-moving, resource-constrained organizations is highly desirable. Solid understanding and practical experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and associated concepts, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and various prompting techniques (e.g., Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain of Thought). Experience implementing services or applications built on top of foundational LLMs (via APIs or open-source models). Experience with LLM training, fine-tuning (e.g., LoRa), and/or developing custom evaluation benchmarks. Familiarity with advanced AI architectures and concepts such as agentic systems (e.g., ReAct), multi-modal models, Mixture of Experts (MoE), or LLM tooling/external capabilities. Experience with MLOps practices and cloud-based ML platforms (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, Google AI Platform). Familiarity with AI Developer and Agentic Frameworks (e.g., OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI, Autogen) Experience contributing to AI/ML research, publications, or open-source projects. The Whole Person Promise: At Bandwidth, we’re pretty proud of our corporate culture, which is rooted in our “Whole Person Promise.” We promise all employees that they can have meaningful work AND a full life, and we provide a work environment geared toward enriching your body, mind, and spirit. How do we do that? Well… Are you ready for an awesome internship experience? At Bandwidth we’re all about making your time with us fun and fulfilling!
