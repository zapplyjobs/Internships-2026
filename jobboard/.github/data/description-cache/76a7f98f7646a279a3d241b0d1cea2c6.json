    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role As a designer at Anthropic, you’ll work alongside product managers, engineers, and AI researchers to shape experiences that transform Claude from a tool into a trusted collaborator: We design products that solve real problems by combining deep understanding of user needs with our unique perspective on LLMs. Design plays a critical role in building transformative AI systems that feel reliable, interpretable, and trustworthy. Designers give shape to our vision for tremendous human progress through AI. We leverage unique skills like storytelling and prototyping to communicate ideas and their feasibility. We execute on interaction and visual details with a high degree of polish, focusing on shipping, learning, and continuous improvement. Read more here for the type of features we build. Responsibilities: Design intuitive onboarding flows that help new users get started quickly, understand Claude's capabilities, and achieve their goals in the first session. Create scalable education systems that help people deepen their understanding of Claude over time and seamlessly integrate it into their workflows Design clear, trust-building upgrade experiences that help users understand the right plan for their needs. Uncover barriers that prevent users from getting the most out of Claude and create experiences that empower them to make it a trusted part of their routine.

Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
