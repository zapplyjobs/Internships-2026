    "description": "About Clerk Clerk is on a mission to solve user management once and for all. We are a globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like &lt;SignUp/&gt; , &lt;SignIn/&gt; , &lt;UserProfile/&gt; , useUser , and useOrganization . These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs . Our Dashboard is a primary tool for configuring our components, as well as a centralized place for managing your app’s users. What you will do You’ll join Visual Designers, UI Engineers, and fellow Product Designers on the Clerk Design team to build our core product, the Clerk Dashboard . You’ll always keep developer experience first as you gain a deeper understanding of the business needs of user management. You’ll optimize for customer delight, flexibility, and ease-of-use within a complicated, technical domain. We will expect you to: Collaborate with teammates to design new features . You’ll work closely with Product, Design, and Engineering across project lifecycles from ideation to implementation. Gather requirements . You’ll research the technology and customer impetus behind the features we release. You’ll attain a deep understanding of the problems we solve. Structure and prototype . You’ll create flows and interactions that make sense of complex information, whether it’s a static component or a multi-page view. Not settle for less than pixel-perfection . You’ll work with a world-class UI Engineering team to bring your Figma frames to life. You set the bar for quality. Elevate our design culture . You’ll support and expand the Clerk Design visual language, component library, accessibility practices, design system, and design processes. Who you are You’re a Senior(+) level Product Designer with experience working in authentication, user management, or developer tools. You love your craft. You push Engineers to build experiences they’re unsure if they’re capable of (and you expect them to do the same for you). You’re in the Americas. The Clerk Design team is spread across the globe; Product Design currently spans UTC+1 to UTC+5:30. You live in a location that is ±3 hours within U.S. Mountain Time (MDT, UTC−06:00). You have technical fluency. You have a deep understanding of designing interactive software on the web. You don’t need to author production-ready front-end code, but it’s a big plus if you can. You work iteratively . Your process embodies a “ship and iterate” mentality. You value the quick pace of a growing startup like Clerk. You own your time. You’re a self-starter who would rather find a tough problem to solve instead of waiting for a new task. To be successful at Clerk, you need to make the most of the autonomy you’re given.
