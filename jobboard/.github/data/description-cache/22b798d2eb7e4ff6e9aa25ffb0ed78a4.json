    "description": "IntroductionASML US, LP brings together the most creative minds in science and technology to develop lithography machines that are key to producing faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient microchips. We design, develop, integrate, market and service these advanced machines, which enable our customers - the world’s leading chipmakers - to reduce the size and increase the functionality of their microchips, which in turn leads to smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. As the world’s leading semiconductor lithography machine (the machine that makes computer chips) manufacturer, ASML enables chip manufacturers to make cheaper, faster chips, thereby enabling all the technology you use today. Our headquarters are in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, and we have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Wilton, CT, Chandler, AZ, San Jose, CA and San Diego, CA. We are currently recruiting for internships located at our office in San Diego, CA (EUV laser source creation).  This internship offers a unique and exciting opportunity to join a dynamic and innovative Technology Development team, focused on conceiving and demonstrating the technologies required for next generations of high-power extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources. The EUV source technology development team is responsible for identifying system-level operating points for stable EUV production generated from laser produced plasmas and helps to chart the path to  increase EUV power to meet the future needs of the Lithography industry. If you like extreme challenges and want to help bring the next generation of technology to the world, then start your adventure and join ASML.Internship Goals and Objectives:We are looking for an enthusiastic and curious intern to support various research and technology development activities, including data analysis and visualization, modeling and test execution.Your AssignmentThe summer 2026 project will focus on research topics around simulations of EUV-generating laser-produced plasmas (LPPs) by enhancing existing models, executing such for various input conditions, and post processing the output data.The intern is expected to drive infrastructure set-up for radiation hydrodynamics and atomic emission codes, develop a workflow for running simulations and post-processing simulation outputs, and connect these codes to existing models.The intern will work in a team environment alongside experienced engineers and scientists, while having ownership over their project.Specific tasks will be tailored to match the education and experience level of the intern as well as the intern’s learning objectives for the summer.A goal of the internship is for you to learn about working in a corporate setting and to provide hands on experience solving real world problems in a team environment.Interns will typically be required to document and present their findings as well as making an end of summer presentation to the group about what they achieved during their internship.Your Profile:Actively studying towards a degree in Physics, Optics, Engineering, or computer science with a minimum of two years completed.Matlab and/or Python experience, modelling skills, C++ experience is a plus.Background in light-matter interaction or plasma physics strongly preferred.Possess strong ownership characteristics and commitment to achieving results on timeHave strong written and oral communicative skillsBe a demonstrated “team player” with a quality orientation and interpersonal skillsHave strong problem solving skills and the ability to take initiative with little guidanceBe willing to accept feedback from a variety of stakeholdersThe current base annual salary range for this role is currently $18.00  -  $56.00. Pay scales are determined by role, level, location and alignment with market data. Individual pay is determined through interviews and an assessment of several factors that that are unique to each candidate, including but not limited to job-related skills, relevant education and experience, certifications, abilities of the candidate and pay relative to other team members. Our recruiters can share more information about our bonus program, benefits and equity during the hiring process.This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the United States Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.Inclusion and diversityASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce.
