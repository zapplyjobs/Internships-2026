    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Enterprise is central to Anthropic's mission. The organizations that could benefit most from Claude in healthcare, financial services, and government are often the most demanding buyers, with rigorous requirements around security, compliance, and control. We believe earning their trust is essential to ensuring AI benefits the world broadly. We're looking for a software engineer to join our Enterprise Foundations team—the team that makes Claude enterprise-ready at scale. When a Fortune 500 company wants to roll out Claude to 50,000 employees, we're the team that makes it possible. You'll build the foundational systems that large organizations require before they can deploy AI at scale: role-based access controls, enterprise identity integrations, admin experiences, and analytics infrastructure. This work directly converts product-market fit into revenue by removing the deployment blockers that prevent large organizations from adopting Claude broadly. This role sits at the intersection of enterprise product, platform infrastructure, and go-to-market. You'll partner closely with product, design, sales, and customer success to understand what our largest customers need, then translate those requirements into scalable technical solutions that work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. Core Responsibilities Design and build permission infrastructure including groups-based access control, role management Develop admin experiences that make complex access control intuitive—enabling admins to beta test features with pilot groups, set spend controls by department, and manage permissions at scale Build enterprise analytics capabilities including on-demand reporting, usage analysis, and APIs that let enterprises integrate Claude data with their existing BI tools Design, build, and ship enterprise-grade products with high standards for security, reliability, and scalability Collaborate closely with Product Platform, Enterprise End User, GTM, and Verticals teams to ensure architecture works across all Anthropic products You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, with experience building enterprise SaaS platforms or admin tools Strong background building identity and access management systems, including SSO integration, SCIM provisioning, or RBAC implementations Experience designing systems that scale from small teams to large enterprise deployments Track record of building products that successfully serve enterprise customers with demanding security and compliance requirements Ability to work effectively across product, design, sales, and customer success functions Motivation to work in a fast-moving environment where enterprise requirements evolve rapidly Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience with AI/ML products and understanding how enterprises evaluate and deploy AI tools Background with compliance frameworks for regulated industries (SOC2, HIPAA) and enterprise audit logging requirements Experience building billing or consumption-based pricing infrastructure Familiarity with data residency and sovereignty requirements across global regions Startup experience, particularly in scaling enterprise platforms from early adoption to broad deployment The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
