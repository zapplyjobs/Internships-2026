We’ve moved beyond \"Big Radio's\" analog past to build the Relay SOAR™ Platform, which treats voice and movement as the new keyboards of the enterprise. By capturing the \"Human Signal,\" we enable frontline teams in hospitality, manufacturing, and healthcare to move from reactive chaos to proactive control. Ranked among the fastest-growing tech companies in North America, we are looking for the next generation of \"Relayers\" to help us digitize the final frontier of the workforce.

You will gain hands-on experience leveraging a SQL-based data warehouse, contributing to high-throughput data pipelines, and developing visualizations that directly influence business decisions. High-performing interns may be considered for full-time roles after graduation, depending on business needs. What You Will Do Analyze: Use SQL to extract, clean, and reshape raw data to answer diverse questions from stakeholders. Build & Maintain: Design, develop, and maintain business intelligence dashboards and reports.

Technical Curiosity: A creative drive to ask questions and deeply understand the data and the business needs behind it. Scripting: Proficiency in Python or R for data cleaning and scripting. Pragmatism: Good time management skills; you understand that a fast, maintainable solution is often better than a slow, complex one. Preferred Qualifications Experience with a dashboarding tool (Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Metabase, etc.). Exposure to general programming and software engineering principles (e.g., version control, modular code, testing). Familiarity with Linux, command line interfaces (CLI), and cloud computing services. Previous experience with SaaS company operations or metrics.

Massive Scale: Be part of a platform that processes over 1 billion data points every week. Our tech isn't just \"cool\"—it’s essential infrastructure for the global economy. LIT Culture (Learning, Impact, Teamwork): We pride ourselves on an environment where early-career professionals have a seat at the table and see their work impact global brands immediately.
