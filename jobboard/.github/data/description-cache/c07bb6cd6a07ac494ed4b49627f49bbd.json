Our mission is BIG.Our TRANSFORMATION is key – bringing the right businesses together to LEAD the ENERGY TRANSITION. Our TEAM is ready.Addressing the climate crisis is an urgent global priority and we take our responsibility seriously. Building on over 130 years of experience tackling the world’s challenges, GE Vernova is uniquely positioned to help lead the energy transition by continuing to electrify the world while simultaneously working to decarbonize it. GE Vernova helps customers power economies and deliver electricity that is vital to health, safety, security, and improved quality of life.Job DescriptionJob Description:We invite a graduate-level intern to strengthen integration between our world's fastest meso-coupled GPU-based large-eddy simulation (LES) and AI/machine-learning calibration algorithms for wind resource and wake prediction. You’ll work with a mature LES platform (including actuator-disk and/or engineering wake models) and fuse simulation outputs with met-mast and turbine data from our fleet. The objective is time-correlated predictions that sharpen annual energy production (AEP) and loads estimates, improve wind turbine suitability decisions, and create clearer view of risk and value.Project Outcomes: Scope is intentionally flexible. Potential tracks include:1. Designing and running focused LES studies across key terrain/stability regimes2. Validating predictions against multi-height mast and SCADA data with clear performance metrics3. Quantifying bias and uncertainty to support decision thresholds4. Training fast surrogate models for layout and risk screening5. Prototyping practical methods to better align simulations with observed conditions.Primary Skills Developed:Skills you’ll develop:• Practical data-analysis workflows; CFD/LES and atmospheric boundary-layer fundamentals• Python data science at scale (Xarray/Dask/Pandas)• Modern machine-learning methods for regression and time-series prediction• Statistical evaluation and uncertainty quantification• Reproducible, version-controlled workflows• Clear technical communication.Business value: reducing uncertainty in turbine suitability, AEP, and loads improves siting, curtailment strategy, and financial models. High-impact outputs will be piloted on live projects and, if effective, integrated into our internal assessment toolkit.Internship Term Dates:May/June - August 2026Qualifications:Currently pursuing a Masters or Doctorate in Engineering, Mathematics, or Applied ScienceMinimum GPA 4.0 / 5.0 scale.Desired Qualifications:Experience running Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modelsProficiency in scientific Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Xarray.Experience with data mining, data engineering, or machine learning techniquesFamiliarity with high performance cloud computing environmentsExperience in atmospheric flows and wind-farm atmosphere interactionsFamiliarity with remote sensing applied to atmospheric measurements (Lidar, Sodar, Radar)Experience using Aero-elastic simulation tools such as FAST, Flex, or BladedBenefits Available to you: Addressing the climate crisis is an urgent global priority, and at GE Vernova, we take our responsibility seriously.
