    "description": "Remote | Must be based in the United States Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth. We’re looking for a Enterprise Account Executive to help us scale our impact with some of the largest and fastest-moving companies in the United States. This is a high-ownership role where you’ll lead complex sales cycles, work directly with founders and technical teams, and shape the future of how enterprises build with Supabase. We have thousands of developers singing up to use Supabase every week &amp; many of them are from large enterprises. In this role, you will focus on helping developers adopt more supabase and expand usage into other areas of the company. This is a critical role where we are looking for someone who loves working full cycle (prospecting through renewals). What You’ll Do Own a portfolio of high-value accounts across the US with a focus on long-term growth and technical depth. Lead full-cycle sales: prospecting, qualifying, negotiating, and closing new and expansion deals. Build trusted relationships with senior stakeholders (Developers, C-level, VPs, engineering leaders) and align on their strategic goals. Deeply understand our product and roadmap to guide enterprise adoption of Supabase’s open-source stack. Partner cross-functionally with Solutions, Product, and Engineering to unblock deals and create long-term value. Bring structure to the enterprise sales process: keep clean pipelines, document rigorously in SFDC, and forecast accurately. Share feedback from the field to inform GTM strategy and product direction. We’ll Expect You To Operate independently. You are comfortable making bold, strategic decisions and asking for help when needed. Prioritize customer value over quick wins. You know how to drive urgency without compromising trust. Elevate the bar across the team through knowledge-sharing, proactive collaboration, and a bias toward action. Bring strong fundamentals in discovery, storytelling, technical alignment, and negotiation. Have a clear plan and own your number. You Might Be a Fit If You Have 6+ years of experience selling technical products to enterprise accounts. Are familiar with databases, cloud infrastructure, or developer tooling, or excited to get up to speed fast. Have a proven track record of overachievement in a quota-carrying role. Know how to navigate large orgs, identify champions, and drive momentum across technical and commercial stakeholders. Thrive in a fast-moving environment with high autonomy and clear expectations. Genuinely care about helping customers build great things. What We Offer Fully Remote We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere.
