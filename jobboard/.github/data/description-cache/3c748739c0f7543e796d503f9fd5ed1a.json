    "description": "&lt;strong&gt;About The Company&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fourier is working on making on-site Hydrogen universally accessible. Our breakthrough architecture enables highly modular and fully automated electrolyzers that scale to any size and optimize efficiency at all loads. We are on a mission to transition the global energy landscape towards a purely sustainable and emission-free future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This internship will involve supporting the design and validation of our commercial product. The intern will contribute to the design of a regenerative drying and purification system to enable efficient and continuous production of high-purity hydrogen. Working closely with an R&amp;amp;D engineer, the intern will characterize thermal/separation processes, develop control systems, and optimize operating parameters to satisfy key reliability and cost constraints. As the directly responsible individual overseeing an experimental test station, the intern will develop a data analysis framework to provide key insights into long-term physicochemical phenomena. The role may involve working with vendors to design and develop custom components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently pursuing or recently completed a B.S. or M.S. in Chemical / Materials / Mechanical / Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, Physics or similar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfortable rolling up their sleeves to work with basic mechanical/electrical components, troubleshoot independently, and motivated to take ownership (agency) of hands-on lab work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong fundamentals and problem-solving intuition in one or more of the following areas: thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, reaction kinetics, phase equilibria&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thrives in a fast-moving environment and can learn, iterate, and execute with velocity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must be available to start in February/March 2026 and work on-site in Mountain View, CA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highly organized with strong attention to detail and a commitment to following through (accountability)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clear, thoughtful communicator who works well on small, collaborative teams&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
