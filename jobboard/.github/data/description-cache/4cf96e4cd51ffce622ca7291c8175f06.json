    "description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve.

About the Role: We are seeking a creative, experienced attorney who wants to apply their deep expertise in employment law (and co-employment issues) to help shape tech-forward products and services for small businesses. This is a unique opportunity to help build Gusto's Professional Employer Organization (PEO) offerings and drive Legal & Compliance cross-functional workstreams for one of Gusto's most strategic new business lines. In this role, you will move fluidly between providing front-line advice on Professional Employer Organization (PEO), Human Resource, and co-employment issues, and partnering with colleagues to ensure delivery of advice and counsel across all Legal & Compliance-related workstreams. You will be a key collaborator and primary point of contact for the PEO business teams. Success in this role will require an ownership mindset, experience driving major product launches, and a focus on curiosity, collaboration, flexibility, and a good sense of humor. Attorneys are expected to use AI tools to accelerate research and processes, synthesize insights, and refine positioning and content with speed and precision, while maintaining accuracy and consistency with legal best practices. About the Team: Gusto’s Legal & Compliance team partners with product and engineering teams to enable innovation, facilitate responsible company growth, accelerate the Gusto roadmap, and provide compliant products to our customers through solution-focused counsel on legal and business risks.

Drive legal and compliance workstreams and cross-functional collaboration for pre-launch milestones, compliance frameworks, vendor onboarding, and Go-to-Market readiness. Advise on risk, product design, features, and operational workflows; address compliance with employment, payroll, HR, licensing, and other requirements relevant to the PEO offering. Develop actionable guidance, templates, and internal training for PEO-related products. Partner cross-functionally and build consensus with Legal and Compliance, Product, Finance, and Operations teams. Create and maintain PEO-related compliance work-product to support internal compliance tracking and content creation processes. Here’s what we're looking for: 7+ years of legal experience, including in-house experience at a technology company. Experience must include employment law, litigation, and product counseling. We have a strong preference for PEO experience. We encourage exceptional candidates without PEO experience to apply if they have a demonstrated ability to quickly acquire deep expertise in complex new legal domains. Deep experience providing pragmatic legal guidance on tech products and employment obligations. Demonstrated ability to build consensus and strong working relationships. A collaborative, solution-oriented mindset with a focus on progress and teamwork (no job is too big or too small).

Our cash compensation amount for this role is between $177,000 - $208,000/year in Denver and $208,000 - $245,000/year for New York/San Francisco. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate location, experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. Compensation for this position also includes an equity package and performance bonuses. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City.
