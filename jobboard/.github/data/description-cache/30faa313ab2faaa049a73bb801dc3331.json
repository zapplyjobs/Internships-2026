    "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role We're seeking an exceptional engineer to join Anthropic's Detection Platform team to build and scale our next-generation security analytics infrastructure. In this role, you'll architect and implement data pipelines that process massive amounts of security telemetry, develop ML-powered detection systems, and create innovative solutions that leverage Claude to transform security operations. Responsibilities: Build AI-powered platform responsible for all aspects of D&R capabilities from detection development to incident response Design and implement scalable data pipelines for ingesting and processing security telemetry across our rapidly growing infrastructure Architect solutions for storing and efficiently querying large volumes of security-relevant data Create rapid prototypes and proof-of-concepts for new security tooling and analytics capabilities Work closely with security and infrastructure teams to understand requirements and deliver solutions Mentor engineers and contribute to hiring and growth of the Security team Participate in on-call shifts You may be a good fit if you: 7+ years of experience in software engineering with a focus on security, infrastructure and/or data pipelines Track record of building and maintaining internal developer tools or security platforms Strong understanding of data processing pipelines and experience working with large-scale logging systems Experience with: Test-driven software development and/or CI/CD (plus for direct experience with Detection-as-code workflows) Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation) Query optimization for large datasets Experience with building stable and scalable services on cloud infrastructure and serverless architectures Ability to write maintainable and secure code in Python Experience working with security teams and translating requirements into technical solutions Ability to lead technical projects with minimal guidance Track record of driving engineering excellence through high standards, constructive code reviews, and mentorship Proven ability to lead cross-functional security initiatives and navigate complex organizational dynamics Outstanding communication skills, translating technical concepts effectively across all organizational levels Demonstrated success in bringing clarity and ownership to ambiguous technical problems Strong systems thinking with ability to identify and mitigate risks in complex environments Strong candidates may also have experience with: Experience building security tooling from the ground up Background in implementing security monitoring solutions (SIEM, log aggregation, EDR) Background in detection engineering or security operations Experience with: SOAR platform/automation development Data lake / Database architecture API design and internal platform creation Track record of applying ML/AI to security problems Experience scaling security operations in a high-growth environment Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
