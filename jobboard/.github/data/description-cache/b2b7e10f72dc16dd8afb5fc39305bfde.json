    "description": "WHY JOIN ALO? Mindful movement. It’s at the core of why we do what we do at ALO—it’s our calling. Because mindful movement in the studio leads to better living. It changes who yogis are off the mat, making their lives and their communities better. That’s the real meaning of studio-to-street: taking the consciousness from practice on the mat and putting it into practice in life.At ALO, we merge art, data, and mindfulness. You’ll be part of a team shaping how technology enhances well-being and creativity—using data not just to optimize, but to inspire.
