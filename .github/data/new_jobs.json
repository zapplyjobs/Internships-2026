    "job_description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: Gusto is seeking an experienced Workforce Scheduling / Intraday Team Lead who thrives on strategic thinking and solving complex contact center challenges. Reporting into the Workforce Management (WFM) team, you will play a critical role in scaling operations to support Gusto’s next phase of growth. While this role does not have formal direct reports, it carries strong leadership influence. You will serve as the scheduling subject-matter expert, process owner, trainer, and primary point of contact for multi–line-of-business scheduling operations. Lead and optimize scheduling across multiple lines of business, ensuring alignment between forecasts, staffing, skill mix, shift design, and service-level goals. Act as the primary point of contact for scheduling-related questions, decisions, and escalations, especially when management is unavailable. Own and maintain scheduling documentation, including procedures, job aids, governance guidelines, escalation protocols, and version-controlled process flows. Drive continuous improvement by identifying inefficiencies, standardizing practices, and recommending automation or tooling enhancements. Ensure operational readiness for staffing changes, training blocks, peak events, special projects, and business transitions by anticipating impacts and adjusting schedules to maintain service levels and employee engagement. About the Team: You’ll partner closely with WFM analytics, operations leadership, HR/training, and vendor or agency partners to ensure scheduling strategies support business goals and a strong customer experience. Provide training, guidance, and mentorship to schedulers, WFM peers, and operations stakeholders to ensure clarity on scheduling processes, tools, and change controls. Collaborate with WFM analytics and operations leaders to deliver insights on scheduling performance, including forecasting accuracy, schedule adherence, occupancy, shrinkage, and staffing variances. Prepare dashboards and executive-ready summaries and present findings to senior leadership. Facilitate cross-functional coordination to align scheduling strategy with customer experience standards and workforce needs. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Own the end-to-end scheduling process for all supported lines of business—translating forecast and staffing plans into optimized schedules that balance operational efficiency, employee experience, and service level attainment. Serve as the primary point of contact (POC) for all scheduling-related escalations, change requests, and optimization opportunities; provide clear guidance and resolution in partnership with Real-Time Management and Operations. Collaborate cross-functionally with Forecasting, Intraday Management, Operations, and Vendor Management to ensure cohesive workforce strategies that align with business priorities and evolving support needs. Lead weekly scheduling and staffing reviews, bringing forward data-driven insights on performance-to-plan, shrinkage trends, and schedule adherence; facilitate informed decision-making among WFM and Operations partners. Provide peer-level mentorship and training to schedulers, fostering consistency, accuracy, and adoption of best practices in alignment with SWPP scheduling standards. Act as a knowledge resource for tools, systems, and governance protocols. Analyze schedule efficiency, shrinkage, and coverage trends, identifying gaps or inefficiencies; recommend and implement data-informed improvements to enhance utilization, flexibility, and service delivery. Partner with WFM leadership to design and refine scheduling policies, procedures, and automation strategies—driving innovation and standardization across the scheduling discipline. Maintain and continuously improve documentation for scheduling workflows, standards, templates, and change control processes—ensuring clarity, audit readiness, and cross-team alignment. Support operational readiness by proactively planning for peak events, business changes, and special projects; anticipate impacts and adjust schedules to maintain SLA and employee satisfaction. Represent WFM in leadership discussions by preparing and presenting scheduling insights, metrics, and recommendations to senior stakeholders—ensuring visibility into workforce performance and tradeoffs. Here’s what we're looking for: 5+ years of Workforce Management experience supporting a multi-channel, multi-line-of-business contact center, including back-office staffing and support functions. Proven expertise in end-to-end scheduling management, including planning, optimization, and intraday alignment to forecast and service-level goals. Hands-on experience with NICE IEX (or similar WFM systems) for schedule creation, maintenance, and reporting across complex business environments. Strong analytical and technical skills with proficiency in Tableau, Business Intelligence (BI) tools, and SQL—capable of building dashboards, extracting data, and translating insights into operational recommendations. Demonstrated exposure to or experience leveraging AI-driven workforce optimization tools, automation, or predictive analytics to enhance scheduling efficiency and accuracy. Advanced proficiency in Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs, Slides) or Microsoft Excel (pivot tables, formulas, scenario modeling) for WFM analytics and reporting. Exceptional communication and presentation skills, with the ability to effectively synthesize complex data and confidently present findings and recommendations to senior leadership and cross-functional partners. Proven ability to collaborate and influence across functions, building strong partnerships with Forecasting, Intraday, Operations, and Vendor teams to ensure cohesive workforce strategies. Highly organized, detail-oriented, and disciplined—able to manage multiple priorities, maintain accuracy under tight timelines, and deliver consistently in a fast-paced environment. Demonstrated commitment to process improvement and standardization, leveraging technology and best practices to enhance scheduling accuracy, transparency, and team alignment. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $105,000/yearly to $129,00/yearly in Denver and most remote locations, and $127,000/yearly to $156,000/yearly in San Francisco and New York. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate location, experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Team As part of the Anthropic security department, the compliance team owns understanding security and AI safety expectations, as established by regulators, customers and (nascent) industry norms (which we also seek to influence). The compliance team uses this understanding to provide direction to internal partners on the priorities of security and safety requirements they must meet. The compliance team assures regulators and customers that those expectations are met by earning security credentials and responding to direct inquiry about Anthropic's security program from auditors, customers and partners. This opportunity is unique, as we work to secure today’s most novel and valuable asset types, we must build a new kind of compliance program, assuring the safety of artificial intelligence capabilities. Responsibilities: Understand how Anthropic's security and privacy capabilities across major cloud platforms implement common frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, CSA CCM, and SOC 2). Build scalable data center and cloud compliance processes and documentation systems that will support future expansion to additional geographies and compliance frameworks. Assess and mitigate security and operational risks, implementing corrective actions, and managing vendor compliance. Coordinate engagements with independent assessors to earn security and privacy certifications and attestations important to Anthropic customers and enterprise partnerships, and to meet regulatory obligations. Write, update and enact policies capturing security, privacy, and AI safety requirements. Maintain and enhance Anthropic's system of security controls through audit readiness, recordkeeping, and cross-functional communication. You may be a good fit if you: Have 8+ years of progressive experience in audit and compliance roles, with direct ownership of certification/attestation projects Have worked in cloud-native environments and understand security and privacy considerations for multi-cloud architectures Can translate complex compliance requirements into actionable workstreams for technical and non-technical stakeholders Have built common controls frameworks or GRC systems that scaled with organizational growth Write clear and useful security and privacy documentation for both external and internal audiences. Thrive in ambiguous, fast-paced environments where you'll need to build processes from scratch Are comfortable organizing time-bounded task management of delegated work streams across a diverse organization Are energized by being the subject matter expert who educates the organization on new compliance requirements Strong candidates may also: Have worked in AI/ML companies and understand unique security considerations for model development and deployment Have worked with cloud companies and understand cloud security controls and physical security requirements Bring experience from high-growth technology companies managing rapid compliance expansion Have some experience implementing automated enforcement of security controls (i.e., compliance as code) Possess relevant certifications (CISA, CRISC, CISM, CISSP, or ISO 27001 Lead Auditor/Implementer) Candidates need not have: Done everything on this list before—we value learning agility and willingness to tackle novel compliance challenges in the AI space Deadline to Apply: None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$255,000 - $345,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
