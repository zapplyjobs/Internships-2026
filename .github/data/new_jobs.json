Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The AI team is focused on one of Stripe’s most strategic growth areas: helping AI-native businesses monetize and scale. We’re in a unique position—partnering with the world’s most ambitious AI companies (like OpenAI, Anthropic and NVIDIA) to help them grow and commercialize globally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Developer Platform team operates at the top of the funnel for the Stripe economy. We are responsible for ensuring that the next generation of businesses build on Stripe by default. As developer workflows shift from manual coding to AI-assisted creation, we view &quot;AI Workspaces&quot; (IDEs, Agents, Coding Assistants) as the new, critical distribution channel for financial infrastructure. Our goal is to secure Stripe’s position as the economic engine for these environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a Business Development Manager to define and execute the commercial strategy for Stripe’s &quot;New Front Door&quot; of these developer platforms. In this role, you will structure and close strategic partnerships with the platforms that command developer attention—transforming AI coding assistants and IDEs into powerful distribution channels for Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will move beyond simple technical integrations to build commercial engines that drive developer acquisition, reduce time-to-value, and lock in long-term platform preference. You will turn the developer’s &quot;creation space&quot; into a competitive moat for Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure commercial ecosystem partnerships:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify, negotiate, and execute high-impact deals with leading foundational model companies, IDEs, and dev-tool platforms. You will define deal structures (commercial terms, co-marketing, GTM commitments) that embed Stripe as the exclusive or preferred financial infrastructure provider.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive distribution and acquisition:&lt;/strong&gt; Treat AI coding environments as a primary user acquisition channel. You will work with partners to design go-to-market motions that surface Stripe at the exact moment of intent, driving net-new merchant signups and integration volume.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercialize technical assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage our technical advantages (like our Model Context Protocol server and Claimable Sandboxes) as strategic currency in negotiations, ensuring partners prioritize Stripe’s deep integration over competitors in exchange for enabling superior capabilities in their own AI tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestrate &quot;Stripe AI Toolkit&quot; GTM:&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborate with Product Marketing and Engineering to package our developer tools and features into a market-facing solution. You will lead the rollout strategy to drive adoption among specific high-value developer segments (e.g., enterprise architects vs. rapid prototypers).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic alignment &amp;amp; market shaping:&lt;/strong&gt; Act as the commercial feedback loop between the external ecosystem and Stripe leadership. You will quantify the business risk of &quot;context gaps&quot; in AI tools and build the business case for new product investments required to win the AI developer market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a commercial leader with a technical edge. You are comfortable negotiating complex contracts with C-level counterparts at major tech companies, but you also understand the developer ecosystem deeply enough to know what drives platform adoption. You understand that in the AI era, being the &quot;default&quot; in the IDE is a commercial imperative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10+ years of experience in business development, strategic partnerships, or platform strategy, with a focus on developer tools, SaaS, or API infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A proven track record of structuring and closing complex, high-value partnerships that resulted in measurable commercial impact (revenue, distribution, or strategic lock-in).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong commercial fluency: ability to model deal economics, negotiate incentives, and align cross-company GTM objectives.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of the developer economy value chain (how tools are bought, sold, and adopted).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional communication skills, with the ability to influence internal product roadmaps based on external commercial opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience leading platform partnerships at a major cloud provider, IDE vendor, or API-first company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;MBA or equivalent commercial experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Stripe’s business model and the broader fintech landscape.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-office expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

You build clear frameworks, playbooks, and calendars that scale across regions, segments, and channels.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data fluent.

Bridge enables faster, cheaper payments and borderless access to dollars via stablecoins. Through our APIs, businesses can send and receive funds across borders faster / cheaper vs. SWIFT and other fiat-only rails. Our virtual accounts enable international consumers and businesses to easily access, store and spend US dollars. Our payouts infrastructure enables platforms to disburse USD to anyone globally. We believe many trillions of dollars will move and settle through stablecoin payment rails. Bridge is pulling this future forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a small team of people who have previously built financial infrastructure at some of the world’s leading companies (Coinbase, Stripe, Square, Brex, Upstart, DoorDash, Airbnb) and each and every one of them chose Bridge because they fundamentally believe that stablecoins will be a critical piece of financial infrastructure that allows for the improvement of global money movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a strategic and creative leader to drive Bridge’s content marketing and social media programs.
