Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Design team works across most projects at Stripe—from our brand standards to campaigns, events, digital products, and even printed publications. Because Stripe’s main audience is other people who build products, we agonize over and take pride in crafting user-friendly and user-focused experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Web Presence &amp;amp; Platform (WPP) team is part of this org, responsible for stripe.com and other consumer-facing web properties. We’re a multidisciplinary group of designers, producers, engineers, and strategists who shape Stripe’s first impression for millions of people worldwide. Our goal is to make every pixel count: raising the quality bar, ensuring consistency, and enabling other teams to tell Stripe’s story on the web with clarity and craft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Producers on WPP are responsible for running stripe.com as a product — managing the projects, systems, and processes that bring Stripe’s story to life on the web. You’ll lead the process alongside incredibly talented Product Managers, Product Marketers, Designers, Engineers, and more to introduce Stripe’s products and initiatives to millions of users through stripe.com.

This role sits at the intersection of product, engineering, strategy, finance, data, GTM and day-to-day execution, ensuring the infra organization is well-informed, running efficiently and poised to deliver on the future product needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a key member of this team, you will tackle a diverse array of challenges that underpin Stripe’s technical foundations which will span system scalability, platform reliability, and efficiency. You will provide the analytical rigor and operational pragmatism necessary to scale &lt;strong&gt;Stripe’s infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; in a way that is both technically resilient and fiscally sustainable.
