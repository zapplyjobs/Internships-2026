    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Customers depend on Datadog’s Incident Management product in crisis moments — when outages threaten their business — and your work will shape how teams respond and learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager II, you’ll own the product that turns chaos into calm: declaring incidents, rallying responders, coordinating remediation, and turning every outage into a learning opportunity that prevents the next one. This is a broad, technically rich product — you’ll own features across real-time UIs, automation, AI-powered summaries and recommendations, documentation and runbooks, task and incident state management, analytics, and deep integrations with third-party chat and video platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll own the features that reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for some of the world’s most complex cloud systems, partnering closely with the rest of the product organization to deliver end-to-end incident response. Your work will be highly visible to customers and internal stakeholders and will shape how organizations run reliable services at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Datadog is uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class end-to-end incident response by surfacing the right telemetry (metrics, traces, logs), orchestrating responders through alerting and paging, and closing the loop with automation and incident management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.
