If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We help companies spend with confidence with integrated corporate cards, banking, and global payments, plus intuitive software for travel and expenses. Tens of thousands of companies from startups to enterprises — including DoorDash, Flexport, and Compass — use Brex to proactively control spend, reduce costs, and increase efficiency on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working at Brex allows you to push your limits, challenge the status quo, and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. We’re committed to building a diverse team and inclusive culture and believe your potential should only be limited by how big you can dream. We make this a reality by empowering you with the tools, resources, and support you need to grow your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Engineering at Brex is about building systems that scale with speed and intention. Our teams span Software, Data, Security, and IT, and operate with high autonomy and deep collaboration. We tackle hard technical problems, own our outcomes, and push for excellence at every level — from architecture to deployment. It’s an environment where engineering is a craft, and builders become leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brex’s Governance, Risk, and Compliance function is at an exciting and pivotal point in our maturity journey and we’re seeking a team member who can seamlessly bridge compliance expertise with technical execution. As a Senior GRC Engineer, you will drive critical GRC processes that mitigate risk, keep us compliant, and build trust with our customers and partners. You&#39;ll evolve the technical foundation of our Trust program by automating security controls, building integrations between security tools and GRC platforms, and creating scalable processes that enable Brex to maintain compliance efficiently as we expand into new markets. You&#39;ll work at the intersection of security, engineering, and compliance — translating regulatory requirements into technical solutions and building automation that eliminates manual toil.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll leverage your deep understanding of SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, AI governance frameworks, and others to both design controls for emerging compliance requirements and mature existing programs through automation and continuous monitoring. You’ll support Trust Assurance, Third Party Risk Management, and other Security Risk Management initiatives. Working with our Engineering, Infrastructure, and Product teams, you&#39;ll translate compliance frameworks into technical controls and build automated systems that help us achieve world-class security as Brex expands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your contributions will directly accelerate Brex&#39;s maturity. You&#39;ll design workflows using Tines, build integrations between security and GRC systems, and create dashboards for security metrics. You&#39;ll implement controls across the technology stack, support multiple audits (SOC 2, PCI DSS, SOX/ITGC, FINRA, ISO), and contribute to AI governance framework implementation (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll have autonomy to build innovative solutions, collaborating cross-functionally to implement controls that enable growth while communicating technical concepts effectively across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you’ll work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role will be based in our San Francisco office.

    "job_description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: This role requires a deep understanding of strategic planning, agile methodology, and program management, with an ability to unify priorities across diverse technical and operational functions. You will collaborate closely with leaders across all CXPI sub-teams, as well as Operations leaders, and CX as a whole, to own the intake, prioritization, sprint execution process, communication, and execution by driving efficiency and ensuring that all initiatives align with strategic CX goals. About the Team: As a Program Manager for Workforce Management (WFM) Programs, you will be a key leader within the CX Planning & Insights team, reporting to the Head of Strategy and Tool Administration. You will be responsible for leading and executing strategic programs focused on optimizing our workforce management capabilities, primarily leveraging the NICE WFM platform. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Establish and manage the centralized intake process for new work across the Data, Quality, WFM, and Tool Administration sub-teams. Partner with leadership to prioritize the backlog, ensuring resource allocation focuses on the highest-impact initiatives aligned with CX goals. Lead and manage complex, cross-functional programs that span multiple CX teams. Oversee end-to-end delivery, ensuring projects are delivered on time, within scope, and meet business objectives. Act as the execution lead, facilitating agile ceremonies (e.g., sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, retrospectives) for the CXPI sub-teams to ensure a smooth and predictable delivery cadence. Serve as the central communication hub, providing clear, consistent, and transparent updates on program status, risks, and dependencies to stakeholders across all levels, including CX leadership and partner teams. Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including CX Operations, Planning, Scheduling, Intraday Management, Technology, and Analytics, to gather requirements, manage dependencies, and ensure successful program execution that directly benefits the WFM teams. Proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks and issues that could impact the delivery of projects across the sub-teams. Manage complex dependencies between Data, Quality, WFM, and Tool Administration initiatives. Drive continuous improvement in program management, prioritization, and execution methodologies within the CXPI organization to increase team velocity and efficiency. Develop and maintain comprehensive program documentation, including roadmaps, program plans, status reports, and key decision logs. Here’s what we're looking for: 7-10+ years of progressive experience in program management, agile delivery, or strategic operations, ideally supporting technical or analytical teams within a high-growth environment. Proven experience managing a cross-functional work intake and prioritization process for multiple sub-teams (e.g., Data, Engineering, Operations, or WFM). Deep understanding and practical experience with agile/scrum methodologies and a track record of successfully facilitating sprints and managing program backlogs. Exceptional program management skills, including planning, execution, risk management, and stakeholder communication for complex, multi-faceted initiatives. Strong ability to influence and build consensus across diverse technical and non-technical teams, including high-level cross-functional leadership. Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills with the ability to synthesize complex information from different sources (Data, Quality, WFM) into actionable execution plans. Proficiency in project management and agile tools (e.g., Jira, Asana, NotionAI). Experience in contact center operations or Workforce Management (WFM) environments is a strong plus. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $94,285/yr to $122,571/yr in Denver & most major metro locations, and $114,695/yr to $149,104/yr for San Francisco & New York. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate location, experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale. Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas.
