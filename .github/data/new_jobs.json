Our offices are open for those who prefer to work in-person and we also support remote work where it aligns with our operational requirements. For certain positions, being close to one of our offices or within a specific geographic area is important to facilitate collaboration, access to resources, or alignment with our service regions. In these cases, the job description will clearly indicate any working location requirements. Our goal is to ensure that all members of our team can contribute effectively, whether they are working on-site, in a hybrid model, or fully remotely. All offers of employment are contingent upon an individual’s ability to secure and maintain the legal right to work at the company and in the specified work location, if applicable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraudulent Employment Offers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Samsara is aware of scams involving fake job interviews and offers.
