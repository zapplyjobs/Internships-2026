Our team designs and builds state-of-the-art generative products for music that create breakthrough experiences for fans and artists. We invent entirely new listening experiences that center and celebrate artists and creatives. All of our products will put artists and songwriters first, through these four principles:\n\nPartnerships with record labels, distributors, and music publishers: We’ll develop new products for artists and fans through upfront agreements, not by asking for forgiveness later.\n\nChoice in participation: We recognize there’s a wide range of views on use of generative music tools within the artistic community. Therefore, artists and rightsholders will choose if and how to participate to ensure the use of AI tools aligns with the values of the people behind the music.\n\nFair compensation and new revenue: We will build products that create wholly new revenue streams for rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, ensuring they are properly compensated for uses of their work and transparently credited for their contributions.\n\nArtist-fan connection: AI tools we develop will not replace human artistry. They will give artists new ways to be creative and connect with fans. We will maximise our role as the place where more than 700 million people already come to listen to music every month to ensure that generative AI deepens artist-fan connections.\nFor more information, see this press release! https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-10-16/artist-first-ai-music-spotify-collaboration/\n",

    "job_description": "ABOUT RETOOL Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software for critical operations like tracking performance metrics, handling customer support workflows, building admin dashboards, and countless other processes you might not have even thought of. But most companies don't have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows. At Retool, we’re building the first enterprise AppGen platform: software that transforms natural language into production-ready code, integrates directly with business data, and meets the highest standards of security and governance.
