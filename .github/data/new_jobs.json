Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You build genuine relationships with your customers: The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You want to be with the best: Samsara’s high-performance culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a team player: At Samsara, sales is a team sport.
