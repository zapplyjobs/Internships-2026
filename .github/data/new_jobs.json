Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nAt Railway, we take the complexity out of shipping software. We aim to make developers more effective by allowing them to ship their code without any fuss — write your code, push it to us, and we deliver it to your end-users. We’re the Railway that takes your code from A to Z in a straight line: no transfers, no mad scrambling for boarding, no chaos in your journey.\n\nThis is a hybrid user-facing role with some full-stack engineering elements. Learn more in our blog post at Support Engineering is Engineering https://blog.railway.app/p/support-engineering-is-engineering. The sister role for this is Senior Software Engineer, Support https://railway.com/careers/senior-software-engineer-support.\n\nWant to learn about our work culture? Here is a four-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work, 2 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-ii, 3 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-iii, and 4 https://blog.railway.com/p/how-we-work-volume-iv).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\n 1. Be the voice of the customer, aggregating their passionate concerns into actionable product outcomes.\n\n 2. Translate customer reports into actionable insights, surface patterns from individual issues, and ensure critical problems reach the right team with proper context.\n\n 3. Create written content for internal and external audiences by writing documentation, runbooks, and customer communications that make infrastructure feel approachable.\n\n 4. Understand the technical landscape our users are coming from and the relief they feel when Railway just works.\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n 1. Native proficiency in English language. Effective writing and communication skills with a personable nature; able to distill difficult technical concepts to a wide range of users\n\n 2. An understanding that behind every deployment failure is a customer’s stress level spiking, and you can navigate both the technical debugging and the human reassurance needed to make things right\n\n 3. An understanding of containers, deployment pipelines, databases, and cloud services well enough to quickly diagnose issues and guide users to solutions.\n\n 4. Deployed apps, wrestled with databases, and debugged mysterious failures. You know enough to speak the same language as our users and diagnose where things went sideways.\n\n 5. A mindset for pattern recognition. See three similar tickets and immediately start connecting dots. Is this a UI confusion? A missing feature? A bug that only happens on Tuesdays? You're constantly surfacing insights that help us fix problems at their root.\n\n 6. The ability to remain the calm expert who makes problems feel solvable; you can context-switch between five different crisis modes while keeping each customer feeling like they're your only priority.\n\nThis role, in our opinion, is perfect for folks who have done tours in Technical Support, Developer Advocacy, or Engineering roles where you worked closely with users.\n\nWe don’t require you to check every box on the list, and we generally prefer working with people that are hungry for knowledge in areas they feel they’re lacking in. Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an application if you find Railway and the role interesting!\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/full-stack.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n      \n      - Go to https://station.railway.com/bounties\n      \n      - Answer up to 5 questions and link them to us\n      \n      - We’ll review the questions in the interview\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    1. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.\n\n 4. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n       \n       1. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1.

We’re seeking a versatile and seasoned Product Designer who strives to create great products, loves collaborating, and takes the initiative. The ideal candidate will derive satisfaction from ideating, designing, and delivering exceptional solutions to hundreds of thousands of developers. This position is tailored for a well-rounded professional who appreciates the art of creative thinking but places equal importance on witnessing their ideas come to life. “Products are made in a factory but brands are created in the mind.” - Walter Landor Want to learn about our work culture? Here is a three-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) About the role Play a pivotal role in Railway's developer experience, redefining the future of software infrastructure. Collaborate closely with product, support, and engineering to scope, define, design, and ship high-quality features. Contribute to the overall design direction of the product, leveraging your creativity and problem-solving skills to address complex design challenges and deliver elegant solutions. Balance user needs, business goals, and technical constraints of design solutions, ensuring that Railway remains user-friendly, scalable, and reliable.

Help us maintain and evolve our internal Design System Work in an ambiguous environment to create levers for design excellence, using process sparingly but effectively. Contribute to the design culture within the company. About you You have a strong portfolio showcasing your skills in user interface design, interaction design, and visual design. Your portfolio demonstrates your ability to solve complex design problems and showcases your attention to detail. You care about creating good products, understand what makes a good experience, and constantly think of improvement opportunities for the products you use. You care about business needs, implications, and the practicality of your solutions and work to deliver clear, intuitive, and appealing human interfaces. You are a creative thinker who can push the boundaries of design while ensuring a balance between user needs, business goals, and technical constraints. You feel comfortable designing, illustrating, iterating, and prototyping in Figma, but always look for new tools to open new possibilities (Blender, Spline, Rive, shaders, etc.). You have experience balancing trade-offs while implementing a feature to ship it on time without compromising the long-term product vision. You have experience effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality designs within project timelines.

Here is a three-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work, 2 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-ii, 3 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-iii, and 4 https://blog.railway.com/p/how-we-work-volume-iv)\n\nAbout the role\n\n - Play a pivotal role in Railway's developer experience, redefining the future of software infrastructure.\n\n - Collaborate closely with product, support, and engineering to scope, define, design, and ship high-quality features.\n\n - Contribute to the overall design direction of the product, leveraging your creativity and problem-solving skills to address complex design challenges and deliver elegant solutions.\n\n - Balance user needs, business goals, and technical constraints of design solutions, ensuring that Railway remains user-friendly, scalable, and reliable.\n\n - Define workflows, prototypes, and visual design of your projects.\n\n - Learn about our users, how they use our platform, understand their pain points, and propose projects to fix them.\n\n - Help us maintain and evolve our internal Design System\n\n - Work in an ambiguous environment to create levers for design excellence, using process sparingly but effectively.\n\n - Contribute to the design culture within the company.\n\nAbout you\n\n - You have a strong portfolio showcasing your skills in user interface design, interaction design, and visual design. Your portfolio demonstrates your ability to solve complex design problems and showcases your attention to detail.\n\n - You care about creating good products, understand what makes a good experience, and constantly think of improvement opportunities for the products you use.\n\n - You care about business needs, implications, and the practicality of your solutions and work to deliver clear, intuitive, and appealing human interfaces.\n\n - You are a creative thinker who can push the boundaries of design while ensuring a balance between user needs, business goals, and technical constraints.\n\n - You feel comfortable designing, illustrating, iterating, and prototyping in Figma, but always look for new tools to open new possibilities (Blender, Spline, Rive, shaders, etc.).\n\n - You have experience balancing trade-offs while implementing a feature to ship it on time without compromising the long-term product vision.\n\n - You have experience effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality designs within project timelines.\n\n - You have excellent communication skills and can articulate design decisions and rationale effectively to stakeholders and team members.\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/Product-designer.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process.\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    1. Review the Railway product and identify one improvement (a redesign of an existing area or a new feature that extends functionality). Then, implement one workflow to illustrate your idea—using either Figma screens, a clickable prototype, or code.\n    \n    2. Deliverable: One workflow in Figma screens, a Figma prototype, or an implementation in code that communicates your vision and design quality.\n    \n    3. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n    \n    4. You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time. What our prior solution looks like, what ideas we have to improve it, etc. Ask away!\n\n 3. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n    \n    2. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 4. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.\n\nFinal Note: The interview goes both ways. Once again, please ask us things. Many things! Hard things. That's what we're here for.",

Our team pioneers and advances state-of-the-art generative technologies for music that create breakthrough experiences for fans and artists. We invent entirely new listening experiences that center and celebrate artists and creatives. All of our products will put artists and songwriters first, through these four principles:Partnerships with record labels, distributors, and music publishers: We’ll develop new products for artists and fans through upfront agreements, not by asking for forgiveness later.Choice in participation: We recognize there’s a wide range of views on use of generative music tools within the artistic community. Therefore, artists and rightsholders will choose if and how to participate to ensure the use of AI tools aligns with the values of the people behind the music.Fair compensation and new revenue: We will build products that create wholly new revenue streams for rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, ensuring they are properly compensated for uses of their work and transparently credited for their contributions.Artist-fan connection: AI tools we develop will not replace human artistry. They will give artists new ways to be creative and connect with fans. We will leverage our role as the place where more than 700 million people already come to listen to music every month to ensure that generative AI deepens artist-fan connections.For more information, see this press release! https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-10-16/artist-first-ai-music-spotify-collaboration/What You'll DoClose Collaboration: Work side-by-side with research scientists to conduct ground breaking research in music generation (diffusion, flow matching, or autoregressive models), as well as related domains like ML-based audio processing, music information retrieval, machine learning, and signal processing.Improve model training pipelines.
