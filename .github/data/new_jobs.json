Whether you’re previewing a new idea from v0 or shipping the next great thing to production, every customer builds — and millions of builds flow through our systems every day. As a Senior Infrastructure Engineer on the CI/CD team, you’ll take ownership of the systems that power these builds at scale. You won’t just contribute features — you’ll be responsible for the design, reliability, and evolution of the platform itself.

Comfortable setting direction and defining architectural standards that scale across teams, balancing long-term vision with pragmatic delivery. Experienced in mentoring and elevating those around you, fostering strong engineering practices. Curious, eager to learn, and motivated to push the boundaries of how modern software gets built and shipped. Bonus If You: Are familiar with React or Next.js Have experience with DynamoDB Have worked to develop a CI/CD platform or internal developer platform used by other engineers.
