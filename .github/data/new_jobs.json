We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment.

This position will have the opportunity to collaborate with various teams across the organization, and assist with the company’s day-to-day and month/quarter-end accounting processes and support accounting transformation projects. This role requires someone with high-positive energy, impeccable attention to detail, a financial and analytic mindset, and a strong desire to get hands-on accounting experience at a rapidly growing organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assist with various areas of the company’s accounting processes, recording daily journals and creating supporting schedules.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assist with preparation of balance sheet reconciliations&amp;nbsp; and supporting schedules&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cross-functional collaboration with FP&amp;amp;A, Tax, Treasury, and Source-To-Pay teams, among others, to ensure proper accounting and financial reporting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare supporting documentation for external audits, including non-US subsidiary statutory financial statements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participate in critical accounting projects, including the implementation of new system logics or enhancements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide support for internal and external audits related to specific areas of responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain compliance with internal controls, policies and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date process documentation and procedures for all tasks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support ad hoc financial information requests and analyses and other special projects as assigned.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess excellent analytical skills, business partnering, problem solving and prioritization skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Able to work well in a dynamic environment&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong work ethic and team player&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Currently pursuing a BA/BS degree in Accounting or related field&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of US GAAP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basic knowledge of SQL and experience working with Snowflake, Looker or similar analytics tools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basic knowledge of digital assets and the crypto economy, or a desire to learn&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;fortidlp-input-element-parent&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;c-message_kit__blocks c-message_kit__blocks--rich_text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;c-message__message_blocks c-message__message_blocks--rich_text&quot; data-qa=&quot;message-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-block_kit_renderer&quot; data-qa=&quot;block-kit-renderer&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-rich_text_block&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-rich_text_section&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Pay Transparency Notice:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Depending on your work location, the target hourly rate for this position can range as detailed below.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;c-message_kit__reaction_bar c-reaction_bar c-reaction_bar--collapsed&quot; data-qa=&quot;reaction_bar&quot; data-stringify-ignore=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;fortidlp-input-element-parent&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Hourly Rate:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$40 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Please be advised that each candidate may submit a maximum of four applications within any 30-day period.
