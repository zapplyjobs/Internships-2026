    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re creating an entirely new payments platform, built with stablecoins, to simplify global money movement. Bridge enables faster, cheaper payments and borderless access to dollars via stablecoins. Through our APIs, businesses can send and receive funds across borders faster / cheaper vs. SWIFT and other fiat-only rails. Our virtual accounts enable international consumers and businesses to easily access, store and spend US dollars. Our payouts infrastructure enables platforms to disburse USD to anyone globally. We believe many trillions of dollars will move and settle through stablecoin payment rails. Bridge is pulling this future forward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a small team of people who have previously built financial infrastructure at some of the world’s leading companies (Coinbase, Stripe, Square, Brex, Upstart, DoorDash, Airbnb) and each and every one of them chose Bridge because they fundamentally believe that stablecoins will be a critical piece of financial infrastructure that allows for the improvement of global money movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an early member of the Bridge engineering team, you will be given the autonomy to work on projects that are truly global in scale and aim to give customers access to products they&#39;ve never had access to. Many of the use cases that we work on today didn&#39;t exist several months ago and that&#39;s because our team is dedicated to constant improvement for our partners and end users. Our Engineers have outsized ownership over projects so if you are looking for increased autonomy working on a completely greenfield opportunity, Bridge is the place for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ship software to build out our suite of API products. We’re an engineering and API-first company, and you will learn first-hand and contribute towards building highly reliable, performant, and mission critical infrastructure serving thousands of developers across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take sole ownership of projects, oftentimes without the support of Product Management, and liaise both internally with teams like Legal/Compliance and externally with our partners and developers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Look for constant improvements to our product offerings with the explicit goal of improving the experience for our partners and end users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Improve engineering standards, tooling and processes for the team and our broader org.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are open to hiring engineers at various levels of seniority (SWE through Senior Staff) but at a minimum we are looking for somebody with 5+ years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building backend systems with SQL databases. Experience with frameworks such as Rails, Django, Express or equivalent is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An enlarged sense of ownership and the ability to lead and influence the design and direction of our products.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An ability to thrive in a fast paced environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A growth mindset and a constant curiosity and fearlessness to dive into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An ability to write maintainable, well-tested, modular code, but also be pragmatic about moving fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to write clear technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Past experience working on crypto or financial products a plus, and while not required, we do look for people who are very passionate about building in this space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with building API products a plus, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience working with blockchain or distributed systems a big plus&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",

Some recent projects include rebuilding our statistics aggregation service, building new service discovery systems, and many user facing projects like making it easy to understand error messages on Stripe Checkout. As a Stripe intern, you&#39;ll be tackling important projects to increase global commerce, while working alongside exceptional people who insist on doing their best work. You’ll learn from people with high standards who are great at inspiring others to do more and go further. We value technical and personal growth, and see our internship program as a vehicle to foster both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write software that will be used in production, and has meaningful impact to Stripe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Give and receive technical feedback through code reviews or design discussions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other engineers and cross-functional stakeholders to proactively seek and incorporate feedback&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Learn quickly by asking great questions, by working with your intern manager and teammates effectively, and by communicating the status of your work clearly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company.

For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don&#39;t necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it&#39;s their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we&#39;re building what users actually want.

Bridge enables faster, cheaper payments and borderless access to dollars via stablecoins. Through our APIs, businesses can send and receive funds across borders faster / cheaper vs. SWIFT and other fiat-only rails. Our virtual accounts enable international consumers and businesses to easily access, store and spend US dollars. Our payouts infrastructure enables platforms to disburse USD to anyone globally. We believe many trillions of dollars will move and settle through stablecoin payment rails. Bridge is pulling this future forward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are building largely in San Francisco, and have a small team of people who have previously built financial infrastructure at some of the world’s leading companies (Coinbase, Stripe, Square, Brex, Upstart, DoorDash, Airbnb) and each and every one of them chose Bridge because they fundamentally believe that stablecoins will be a critical piece of financial infrastructure that allows for the improvement of global money movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As one of the first blockchain engineers at Bridge, you will be given the autonomy to work on projects that are truly global in scale and aim to give customers access to products they&#39;ve never had access to. Many of the use cases that we work on today didn&#39;t exist several months ago and that&#39;s because our team is dedicated to constant improvement for our partners and end users. Our Engineers have outsized ownership over projects so if you are looking for increased autonomy working on a completely greenfield opportunity, Bridge is the place for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build out multi-chain hot wallet infrastructure to support increased reliability of our payments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build smart contracts to increase hot wallet payment throughput.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build smart contract platform to issue custom stablecoins across multiple blockchains (EVM, Solana, Stellar, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build smart contract monitoring systems to detect anomalous events (especially related to minting and burning).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and develop blockchain-based applications and protocols to support stablecoin transactions and integrations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate with cross-functional teams to understand business requirements and translate them into technical specifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Implement and maintain smart contracts, ensuring security and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Perform thorough testing and debugging of blockchain applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Optimize blockchain performance and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stay up-to-date with the latest developments in blockchain technology and integrate relevant advancements into our solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Provide technical guidance and support to other team members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contribute to the overall architecture and design of our blockchain systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are open to hiring engineers at various levels of seniority but in general we would look for somebody with 5+ years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Strong proficiency in blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, Solana or others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with smart contract development using Solidity or other relevant languages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Deep understanding of cryptographic principles and blockchain protocols.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins is highly desirable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of security best practices in blockchain development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An enlarged sense of ownership and the ability to lead and influence the design and direction of our products.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An ability to thrive in a fast paced environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A growth mindset and a constant curiosity and fearlessness to dive into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to write clear technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
