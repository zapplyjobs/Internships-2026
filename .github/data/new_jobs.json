Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're building the infrastructure that enables Claude to act in the world—booking travel, writing code, calling APIs, managing files, and completing multi-step tasks autonomously. This is foundational work for the next generation of AI capabilities. The Agent Infrastructure team designs and operates the execution environments, state management systems, and security boundaries that make autonomous AI agents safe and reliable. You'll work at the intersection of distributed systems, security engineering, and product—building systems that don't exist anywhere else in industry. This is a high-priority initiative. The problems are hard, the scope is greenfield, and the impact is immediate. What You'll Do Design and build sandboxed compute environments where Claude can safely execute code, access tools, and interact with external services Build state management systems for long-running agent tasks—handling checkpoints, recovery, and resumption across failures Develop authentication and authorization frameworks for delegated access—enabling Claude to act on behalf of users securely Create observability and debugging tools for agent execution—understanding what Claude did, why, and how to make it better Partner closely with product and research teams to define what's possible and ship it You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 6+ years of experience building distributed systems, infrastructure, or platform services at the hyper scale Comfortable building Cloud Native infrastructure on GCP, AWS, or Azure Care deeply about security, isolation, and building systems that fail safely Have experience with containers, sandboxing, or secure execution environments (e.g., gVisor, Firecracker, V8 isolates) Are comfortable with ambiguity—this is greenfield work, and you'll help define the architecture Write clean, maintainable code in Python, Go, Rust, or similar Want to work on problems that don't have existing playbooks Strong Candidates May Have Experience building multi-tenant execution platforms or serverless infrastructure Background in security engineering, sandboxing, or isolation technologies Familiarity with workflow orchestration systems (Temporal, Airflow, Step Functions) Experience with state machines, checkpointing, or durable execution patterns Low-level systems experience (Linux internals, eBPF, container runtimes) The annual compensation range for this role is below.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.At Anthropic, we believe new AI capabilities are best achieved through secure foundations, not in spite of them. As capabilities grow more advanced, it is critical that progress moves forward safely and for the benefit of all society. It is the reason why security sits at the center of our work, and not as an afterthought. We're specifically looking for a Software Engineer to help us build and maintain new agentic coding tools for developers. The ideal candidate will have a passion for developer tools, extensive knowledge of diverse programming environments and languages, and experience with advanced LLM features like tool-use, chaining and orchestration patterns, and prompt engineering. Curiosity about AI research is a must! Responsibilities: Design, build, and maintain scalable features and infrastructure for AI-powered development tools Engage directly with developers inside and outside Anthropic to gather insights and improve user experience Collaborate with researchers to improve model capabilities through shared tools and evals Stay ahead of advancements in AI-assisted coding by experimenting with new tools, evaluating emerging techniques, and tracking enhancements to existing ones Contribute across the stack—from front-end UI to back-end infrastructure—to develop new features, fix bugs, and optimize performance Dive into possibly unfamiliar areas like Python notebooks, VS Code plug-ins, and containerized environments. You may be a good fit if you: Are excited about AI-assisted coding as a tool to enhance developer productivity and creativity—not replace human ingenuity Spend a lot of time refining and customizing your AI workflows Have experience building and maintaining dev tools Are an expert in React development, including performance optimization, modern patterns (hooks, context, suspense), and component architecture Specialize in user experience engineering but are a capable full stack developer Have hands-on experience working with large language models and prompt engineering Have worked on projects with stringent safety, security and/or compliance requirements Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work Strong candidates may also have experience with: Building and maintaining CLI tools Working in large codebases and quickly jumping in to unfamiliar development environments Working with container orchestration and cloud infrastructure Scaling TypeScript projects Working with alternate JavaScript runtimes like Bun and Deno The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $560,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're looking for desktop app engineers to join our Claude product team and help build native applications that harness the transformative power of advanced language models. Your mission will be to package our AI capabilities into elegant desktop experiences that put unprecedented capabilities at users' fingertips. You will work with a talented team of engineers, researchers, and product specialists to design and implement key components that bridge our AI technology with intuitive user interfaces. Join us in this exciting mission to transform how people engage with our AI technology and unlock new realms of human potential. Today, our app is mostly web-based – but we’re eager to build the best possible version of Claude for macOS and Windows with a mix of both native and web technologies. You might be a great fit for this role if you’re up for the challenge of learning multiple programming languages. We are more interested in strong engineers excited to learn new languages and technologies to build the best possible experience than we are looking for people with hands-on experience in Chromium, Electron, C++, or the various native macOS and Windows APIs. We believe that strong engineers can learn whatever technology is best suited to build the best possible experience – and we understand that even the best engineers will have little experience with one of the operating systems and areas we’d like to invest in. We’re looking for curious engineers excited to figure out, with us, what AI on the desktop could do. Responsibilities: Develop and maintain the core infrastructure and features within Claude.ai and in our Electron-based desktop app using a typical web stack (TypeScript, React) Use native code (Rust, Swift, C++) to bring advanced features to the desktop app, connecting Claude to macOS and Windows Optimize application performance, memory usage, and startup time across platforms Design and build robust update mechanisms and deployment pipelines Create monitoring tools to track application performance and user experience Build a strong intuition for how advanced LLMs could be most useful on your computer, augmenting humans in their work You may be a good fit if you have: Have 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, with strong emphasis on desktop application development Have practical experience with Electron and deep understanding of its architecture Possess strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills and experience with modern frontend frameworks Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use Have experience with native module development in C++ to extend application capabilities Understand macOS and/or Windows platform-specific technologies and development patterns Have experience with cross-platform application packaging, code signing, and distribution Thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams We’re working with a large number of technologies - and you might be an excellent candidate even if you’ve only worked with a subset of them. An ideal candidate may have never used Electron before but does have hands-on experience in working with Chromium’s C++. Similarly, a great candidate may have worked on Electron apps, but hasn’t used C++ or Swift before. We understand that even the best engineers will have more experience with some platforms than others. Strong candidates may also have experience with: Experience working on and building operating systems, browsers, or deeply OS-integrated software (screensharing, video-calling, game engines, etc) Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities Demonstrated success implementing cross-platform development strategies Vision for the future of AI-powered desktop applications and a drive to make that vision a reality Have experience with IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and security in desktop applications Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The annual compensation range for this role is below.

Similarly, a great candidate may have worked on Electron apps, but hasn’t used C++ or Swift before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We understand that even the best engineers will have more experience with some platforms than others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have experience with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working on and building operating systems, browsers, or deeply OS-integrated software (screensharing, video-calling, game engines, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated success implementing cross-platform development strategies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vision for the future of AI-powered desktop applications and a drive to make that vision a reality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and security in desktop applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply: &lt;/strong&gt;None.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
