Our platform ingests high-rate telemetry, validates complex autonomy software in real time, and helps engineering teams iterate faster without sacrificing safety or precision. We’re a small, fast-moving team of engineers and operators who own problems end-to-end, work across disciplines, and thrive on solving challenges at the intersection of hardware and software. As a dual-use platform, we're serving top-tier commercial and defense customers, including the U.S. Navy, United States Air Force, Shield AI, and Anduril.We’re backed by top-tier investors — Sequoia, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lux Capital, and Lightspeed Ventures — who share our mission to accelerate innovation in mission-critical systems. Our team brings experience from SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition, and other leading companies, united by a common goal: enabling hardware engineers to push the boundaries of advanced technology with speed, safety, and precision.In this pivotal role, you’ll deliver Nominal’s vision of providing continuous testing to the industrial base, equipping engineers to deploy capability at scale, in the shortest time possible.

You find a way forward – even when the playbook doesn’t exist yet. You are a hustler who moves quickly, gets a LOT done, and maintains a consistent bar for excellence.Resilient and persistent: You don’t get discouraged by a “no” and instead use that as fuel to be even more creative. You’re comfortable with repetition and iterating until you land the right message.Strong communication instincts: You can adapt your communication to different audiences – internal and external. You write clearly, ask good questions, and make crisp recommendations. You can draft and adapt outbound for technical engineers or c-suite executives. You can coordinate between sales and marketing orgs to refine our messaging & report on what’s resonating.A builder’s mindset: You want to help build the machine, not just run it.

What You’ll Be Responsible for: Help build and maintain the Supabase Cloud offering; Design and implement systems to provision, scale, and manage the multi-region compute workloads powering Supabase projects in Kubernetes Maintain our Go-based Kubernetes operator that orchestrates distributed Postgres deployments Design and implement robust deployment patterns for EKS and other Kubernetes platforms Work with CSI drivers, persistent volumes, and cross-cloud networking to ensure data reliability and connectivity Own the full lifecycle of compute orchestration: project creation, warm pools, autoscaling, smart region selection, resizing, and resource optimization; Improve automation and observability across the compute stack to ensure high availability and performance; Improve our system architecture to reduce costs while balancing security, reliability, and performance; Collaborate cross-functionally with other teams to help leverage compute as a core platform offering; Participate in on-call rotations, incident response, and post-incident reviews; Resolve escalated support issues, while also identifying and resolving systemic issues across the platform. You might be a fit if you have: Strong software engineering skills - Go and Typescript proficiency required, with experience building production-grade Kubernetes operators or controllers Cloud Infrastructure knowledge - familiarity with AWS constructs is required, past experience using the AWS SDKs and IaC tools (Pulumi, Terraform, etc) to build and operate infrastructure is strongly preferred. Deep Kubernetes expertise - Hands-on experience with Kubernetes internals, custom resources, and cloud-managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS) Production operations mindset - track record of building reliable, observable, and maintainable systems Ownership mindset - you thrive in being able to operate independently with high-level guidance What We Offer Fully Remote We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

    "job_description": "Remote | Must be based in the United States Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth. We’re looking for a Enterprise Account Executive to help us scale our impact with some of the largest and fastest-moving companies in the United States. This is a high-ownership role where you’ll lead complex sales cycles, work directly with founders and technical teams, and shape the future of how enterprises build with Supabase. We have thousands of developers singing up to use Supabase every week &amp; many of them are from large enterprises. In this role, you will focus on helping developers adopt more supabase and expand usage into other areas of the company. This is a critical role where we are looking for someone who loves working full cycle (prospecting through renewals). What You’ll Do Own a portfolio of high-value accounts across the US with a focus on long-term growth and technical depth. Lead full-cycle sales: prospecting, qualifying, negotiating, and closing new and expansion deals. Build trusted relationships with senior stakeholders (Developers, C-level, VPs, engineering leaders) and align on their strategic goals. Deeply understand our product and roadmap to guide enterprise adoption of Supabase’s open-source stack. Partner cross-functionally with Solutions, Product, and Engineering to unblock deals and create long-term value. Bring structure to the enterprise sales process: keep clean pipelines, document rigorously in SFDC, and forecast accurately. Share feedback from the field to inform GTM strategy and product direction. We’ll Expect You To Operate independently. You are comfortable making bold, strategic decisions and asking for help when needed. Prioritize customer value over quick wins. You know how to drive urgency without compromising trust. Elevate the bar across the team through knowledge-sharing, proactive collaboration, and a bias toward action. Bring strong fundamentals in discovery, storytelling, technical alignment, and negotiation. Have a clear plan and own your number. You Might Be a Fit If You Have 6+ years of experience selling technical products to enterprise accounts. Are familiar with databases, cloud infrastructure, or developer tooling, or excited to get up to speed fast. Have a proven track record of overachievement in a quota-carrying role. Know how to navigate large orgs, identify champions, and drive momentum across technical and commercial stakeholders. Thrive in a fast-moving environment with high autonomy and clear expectations. Genuinely care about helping customers build great things. What We Offer Fully Remote We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world. ESOP Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together. Tech Allowance Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work. Health Benefits Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us. Annual Off-Sites Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year. Flexible Work We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.
