This project asks how machine learning models can extract &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;generalizable structure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; from novel, systematically perturbed experimental datasets and apply it to guide exploration of unseen molecular space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this role, you will design and train models that learn the latent “grammar” governing molecular function for our system of interest. Working with a large, novel experimental dataset, you will develop architectures that integrate sequence-level information with geometric and contextual representations. The focus is not merely on improving predictive accuracy, but on uncovering the inductive biases and representational strategies that enable extrapolation—when and why models succeed in new regimes, and when they fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will explore representation learning approaches for molecular design, investigate tradeoffs between foundation-scale models and structured task-specific models, and develop insights that inform both model construction and experimental strategy. There is also an opportunity for experimental validation of model-derived hypotheses, grounding model behavior in measurable biological outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This internship is intended for students who are excited to build models that reveal structure underpinning biology — and who are motivated by contributing work that advances the interface between machine learning and experimental biology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Program Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intensive &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;12-weeks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
