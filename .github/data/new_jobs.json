By recording, analyzing, and indexing conversations, our platform supplies unparalleled alpha to the critical, physical businesses that constitute the backbone of our economy. Our purpose is to bring the technology of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the rest of the economy. As a side effect of this mission, we’ve become one of the fastest growing companies in history. In numbers, that means 0→$40M in 3.5 years, growing 15% MoM, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone’s, and profitability. The Role Rilla engineers architect and ship features across the stack at lightning speed. On a daily basis, you will build end-to-end workflows, take them to production, and solve real world problems across an out-sized scale. As an early technical steward, you will raise the bar for code quality and decision‑making, setting patterns that cement a world‑class engineering culture as we scale. While the company 10×’s, your scope and ownership will grow just as fast—building the tools, mental models, and platforms that let both you and Rilla accelerate exponentially. Do you describe yourself as \"obsessive\"? Do you aspire to be a founder or a leader in applying AI to the physical world? We believe Rilla is the best place — with the best peers — to learn how. Technologies We Use Different languages and frameworks, including React, React Native, Typescript and Python Open-source technologies like Node.js, PostgreSQL, Turborepo, Lodash, and Zod Industry-standard build tooling, including GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Spacelift What We Value An infinite learner . Someone who is relentless in their curiosity. A customer obsessive . Someone who deeply care about delighting customers and solving real pains, not vanity metrics. A winning attitude . You thrive with extreme accountability, learning as a team, and both giving and receiving rapid feedback. Extreme empathy. Our customers are not tech companies. They live and work in the real world. Empathy is critical to arriving at correct solutions. Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more. What We Require Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Javascript, C++, Python, Rust, or similar languages. Strong engineering prowess, ideally developed at start-ups. Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools. Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality. Don’t Work Here Please don't join if you're not excited about: Building an AI product for an industry untouched by modern software Constantly talking to and visiting customers in the field Working ~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC Attempting to build a generational company, and the intensity required to do so Our benefits aim to empower Rilla employees in removing roadblocks to achieving their life’s work. The list below details our available benefits and some of the perks that can be enjoyed as an employee of Rilla. Benefits Medical, dental, and vision insurance Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and supplementary food and drink — 6x a week Gym membership Commuter benefits Relocation assistance Take what you need paid time off, not accrual based $1,000 stipend for learning and personal growth $1,500 a month rent stipend Tech equipment",
