At Samsara, we are helping improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the physical operations that power our global economy. Representing more than 40% of global GDP, these industries are the infrastructure of our planet, including agriculture, construction, field services, transportation, and manufacturing — and we are excited to help digitally transform their operations at scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 300; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including Video-Based Safety, Vehicle Telematics, Apps and Driver Workflows, and Equipment Monitoring. As part of a recently public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Samsara has several emerging go-to-market partner programs that are core engines of significant growth for the company. These include referral and resale partnerships, as well as strategic alliances with the insurance industry, fleet management companies, and technology integrators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Program Manager, GTM Partner Programs, your core responsibility is to integrate the value of partnerships into the DNA of the global Sales organization. You will be the cross-functional expert responsible for the comprehensive design and deployment of programs that equip Account Executives (AEs) to sell effectively with partners and unlock unique customer value at scale. This mandate requires deep collaboration with key internal functions—including Sales Programs, Sales Enablement, Business Value Services, and Customer Outcomes—to embed partnership motions across all critical internal resources, sales tools, and playbooks. Additionally, you will own and drive the Partner Account Management (PAM) playbook, defining and managing the global standard for partner deal orchestration and internal end-to-end management processes. This is a dynamic role with strong potential for growth, requiring you to serve as the primary internal advocate for GTM partner programs, overseeing the entire strategy-to-execution lifecycle and maximizing partnership efficiencies across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a programmatic and strategic role. It is not quota-carrying and does not involve direct external management of partner relationships.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is open to candidates residing in the US &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;except&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the San Francisco Bay Metro Area, the NYC Metro Area, and the Washington, D.C.

Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You build genuine relationships with your customers:&lt;/strong&gt; The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers&#39; value earned trust and human relationships built over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You want to be with the best:&lt;/strong&gt; Samsara’s high-performance culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a team player:&lt;/strong&gt; At Samsara, sales is a team sport.
