This role inherits an existing team with a variety of experience levels with the opportunity to build out further to ensure an adequate level of coverage for our customers. You will join two other regional managers and find a set of well documented processes, policies, and expectations, although there is considerable scope and expectation to re-evaluate and simplify these, in the name of continually improving outcomes for customers alongside our efficiency. You will be driven by working with and expanding the team with exceptional people who care deeply about providing the best customer experience and this will be reflected in your approach to hiring - world class talent that understands the right balance between digging deep and moving fast.
