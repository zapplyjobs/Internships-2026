    "job_description": "Leading the future in luxury electric and mobility At Lucid, we set out to introduce the most captivating, luxury electric vehicles that elevate the human experience and transcend the perceived limitations of space, performance, and intelligence. Vehicles that are intuitive, liberating, and designed for the future of mobility. We plan to lead in this new era of luxury electric by returning to the fundamentals of great design – where every decision we make is in service of the individual and environment. Because when you are no longer bound by convention, you are free to define your own experience. Come work alongside some of the most accomplished minds in the industry. Beyond providing competitive salaries, we’re providing a community for innovators who want to make an immediate and significant impact. If you are driven to create a better, more sustainable future, then this is the right place for you. Software Engineering Intern - API & Cloud Microservices Team: Cloud Microservices Why this Internship Lucid Vehicles are Cloud-connected Computers-on-wheels. You’ll learn how Cloud Software and Lucid Vehicles come together: high-throughput ingestion, reliable APIs, distributed systems, and safety-minded engineering. What You’ll Do Build partner-facing APIs: Build partner-facing APIs: Implement secure, clearly versioned REST/gRPC endpoints that expose Lucid’s Cloud Vehicle OS capabilities, powering customer experiences and orchestrating lifecycle operations across the fleet. Own microservice slices: Design and extend Golang services behind those APIs (request handling, orchestration, persistence, resilience patterns). Data & storage: Model and optimize MongoDB collections, indexes, and queries for evolving, high-volume datasets. Reliability & safety: Add idempotency, pagination, retries/backoff, rate limiting/quotas, and circuit-breaker patterns; write robust unit/integration tests. Security & access control: Help implement OAuth2/client credentials or mTLS, JWT scopes/claims, API keys, audit logging, and least-privilege service RBAC. DX (Developer Experience): Publish OpenAPI/Proto specs, Postman collections, sample clients, and changelogs; contribute to a simple partner onboarding flow and sandbox test harness. Observability: Add metrics, logs, and traces (Prometheus/Grafana/Elasticsearch) and participate in SLI/SLO tracking for key endpoints. (Optional) Frontend: Contribute to Frontend (React/MUI) Minimum Qualifications BS/MS in CS/EE (in-progress) or equivalent experience. Solid programming skills in Golang (or strong in a typed language and eager to ramp on Go). Understanding of HTTP, REST/gRPC, JSON/Protobuf, and backend testing. Database fundamentals (indexes, query performance, transactions/consistency trade-offs). Clear communication and curiosity; you document decisions and ask good questions. Nice-to-Have MongoDB experience (schema design, aggregation, TTL/index strategies). API platform concepts: OpenAPI/Proto, versioning/deprecation, idempotency keys, rate limiting, quotas. Front-end development experience (React) AuthN/Z exposure: OAuth2, mTLS, JWT, service-to-service auth, secrets management. Event/messaging systems (NATS, MQTT, Kafka) and streaming/ingestion patterns. Containers/cloud: Docker, Kubernetes, Istio/Envoy, CI/CD. What Success Looks Like You ship at least one partner-facing API endpoint or microservice feature end-to-end (design, tests, observability, docs) Your code is well-tested, observable, documented, and reviewed without major rework. Partner Developer Experience artifacts (specs, samples, docs) are clear enough for another engineer to integrate with minimal back-and-forth. Program Information: Timing: May- August, or June-September pending class schedules. Duration of Internship: Our internship program is 12 weeks; the end date is flexible based on individual needs. Work Location & Environment: This position will be in Newark, CA, and is fully in-person. You must be prepared to start onsite for your first day of employment. The working environment will be office work. Compensation: Student compensation is based on location and current degree level, non-negotiable ranging from $50 to $70. Relocation: May be provided on a case to case basis. Housing/Transportation: You must provide your own living arrangements and transportation in the local area. Background Check: All offers of employment are contingent on clearing a background check. Drug Screening: All offers of employment are contingent on passing a drug screen. Medical benefits: Dental, vision, and medical on day 1 for all interns working full-time. Visa Sponsorship: Lucid may but is not obligated to sponsor foreign national employees requiring company sponsorship for U.S employment authorization. At Lucid, we don’t just welcome diversity - we celebrate it! Lucid Motors is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.
