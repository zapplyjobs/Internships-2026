    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figma is growing our team of passionate creatives and builders on a mission to make design accessible to all. Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you&#39;re brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you&#39;re excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Figma is a critical part of modern product development, where design and code are core primitives in how builders create, iterate, and ship products. Figma’s Code Platform team builds the foundational infrastructure that enables seamless translation between design, code, and AI-powered creation. Our work powers products such as AI Assistant, Make, Sites, and other Figma surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This team’s and our work will be at the precipice of powering what is possible downstream for users to easily go between design and code. Our mission is to power the interoperability of design &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; code so it can be seamless and magical for our customers; but also ergonomic, scalable, and extendable for the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re hiring engineers to join Code Platform to work on our core code translation infrastructure. This role will focus primarily on deep technical execution, and depending on level and experience, may also include technical leadership responsibilities such as architectural ownership, mentoring, and driving multi-quarter initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work on systems that translate between HTML, JSX, structured design models, and LLM-friendly representations, directly impacting latency, correctness, and product velocity across Figma. This is a rare opportunity to improve and evolve one of the most strategically important abstractions in the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design, build, and improve code ↔ design translation pipelines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Diagnose and resolve performance bottlenecks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and long-running tasks that impact product SLAs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Improve correctness, reconciliation, and fidelity across complex design system and layout edge cases&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build scalable serialization pipelines, internal APIs, and platform utilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Figma Make, AI Assistant, and Sites leads to define the long term product enablement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Improve observability and ownership of key metrics (latency, success rate, correctness)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support and drive architectural direction and long-term platform strategy for a translation surface&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mentor engineers and shape the long-term team structure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years of software engineering experience, especially in web, platform or infrastructure engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong TypeScript/JavaScript and modern frontend fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep experience with declarative UI systems (React, JSX, or similar)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with ASTs, code transformation, or compilation concepts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience debugging performance, rendering, or pipeline latency issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building complex, cross-team platforms with multiple stakeholder groups&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building design systems or component libraries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Platform or infrastructure engineering experience (APIs, observability, SLAs)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rendering, layout, or graphics pipeline knowledge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with structured representations used by LLMs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.
