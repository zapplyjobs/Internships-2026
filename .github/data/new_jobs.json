We are developing a powerful and extensible toolkit that our customers can leverage to solve a variety of different problems and workflows. We’ve seen our most sophisticated customers use the product to run global processes across thousands of employees, coordinate precision manufacturing pipelines, and consolidate previously siloed mission-critical data into a single source of truth.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Airtable’s mission is to bring the power of computing and software development to everyone. We are developing a powerful and extensible toolkit that our customers can leverage to solve a variety of different problems and workflows. We’ve seen our most sophisticated customers use the product to run global processes across thousands of employees, coordinate precision manufacturing pipelines, and consolidate previously siloed mission-critical data into a single source of truth. The complexity of these use cases requires us to be extremely thoughtful about how we design and implement new functionality in the product and make sure it’s both easy to use and comprehend for our customers and maintainable for us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Full-Stack, Backend&lt;/strong&gt; engineer at Airtable, you will have the opportunity to work with customers to deeply understand their needs and workflows. You will collaborate with cross-functional partners across product management, design, research and data science to create innovative new features that enable our customers to do their best work. You will be responsible for owning and executing the end-to-end implementation of these new features that will contribute to making our toolkit even more powerful and successful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We currently have openings on:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Scaled Experiences Team&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;(Full-Stack/BE)&lt;/strong&gt; focuses holistically on the customer problem of using Airtable at scale. Operating at very high scale requires changes to many different product surfaces, which makes this pod somewhat unique: we focus on the business problem across the whole of the Airtable product. The business impact of this pod is aimed at unblocking high-scale Airtable implementations that are in pipeline, and preventing churn by improving the user experience of Airtable at scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Solutions Platform Team (Full-Stack/BE)&lt;/strong&gt; enhances our platform to enable builders to standardize and accelerate builds of large-scale solutions.

We are developing a powerful and extensible platform that our customers can leverage to solve a variety of different problems and workflows. We’ve seen our most sophisticated customers use the product to run global processes across thousands of employees, coordinate precision manufacturing pipelines, and consolidate previously siloed mission-critical data into a single source of truth. The complexity of these use cases requires us to be extremely thoughtful about how we design and implement new functionality in the product and make sure it’s both easy to use and comprehend for our customers and maintainable for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;Full-Stack, Backend &lt;/strong&gt;engineer at Airtable, you will have the opportunity to work with customers to deeply understand their needs and workflows.
