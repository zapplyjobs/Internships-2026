Today, we provide developers with React components like &lt;SignUp/&gt; , &lt;SignIn/&gt; , and &lt;UserProfile/&gt; . These components allow developers to drop authentication and user management into their applications. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs . About the role It’s an exciting time for Clerk, coming off a year of record user growth and product launches that further our vision of making authentication and user management intuitive and enjoyable. Technical Account Executives at Clerk help customers integrate and build on our platform — from developers integrating authentication into their app for the first time, to popular technology companies building complex identity and access management systems.

What you’ll do Own a set of high-potential accounts, ensuring successful launch, adoption, and ongoing expansion. Qualify and prioritize inbound opportunities, while experimenting with selective outbound in high-value segments. Lead discovery and demos with external audiences of all kinds — from engineer to CXO — to understand business objectives and translate requirements into solutions. Oversee onboarding in collaboration with field-facing teams, ensuring customers enjoy amazing user management experiences. Contribute to the team’s revenue and retention goals by building trusted relationships and increasing customer lifetime value. Spend some time analyzing our processes and instigating changes to help scale our user operations. Surface customer insights to product and engineering, ensuring the roadmap reflects real-world needs. Who you are You have a users-first mindset, and keep their needs at the forefront of everything you do. You have a passion for driving growth and helping the team achieve shared targets. You have technical depth, able to dive into APIs, developer workflows, and modern web stacks without needing to hand off. Have an extensive background working in a similar customer-facing role (e.g. sales, solutions, or partnerships). You’re energized by managing a pipeline of opportunities and turning them into long-term partnerships. You enjoy being a trusted advisor, balancing technical credibility with a sharp focus on business outcomes. Thrive in a cross-functional, collaborative environment. Benefits We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated. At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company. We care about your well-being. That's why we offer top-tier health insurance to ensure that your health needs are fully met. Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best. We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence. Join our exceptional, globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.",
