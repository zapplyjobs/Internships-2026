experience and training; licensure and certifications; and other business and organizational needs. The disclosed range estimate has not been adjusted for the applicable geographic differential associated with the location at which the position may be filled. At Deloitte, it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range for their role and compensation decisions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. A reasonable estimate of the current range is $29.64/hour to $59.50/hour.</p></font></div> <font face=\"Verdana\"><span></span></font> <p style=\"line-height: normal; font-family: Verdana; margin-bottom: 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: black;\"></span></strong></p> </font></div>",
