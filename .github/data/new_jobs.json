At Samsara, we are helping improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the physical operations that power our global economy. Representing more than 40% of global GDP, these industries are the infrastructure of our planet, including agriculture, construction, field services, transportation, and manufacturing — and we are excited to help digitally transform their operations at scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 300; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including Video-Based Safety, Vehicle Telematics, Apps and Driver Workflows, and Equipment Monitoring. As part of a recently public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an Enterprise Sales Engineer at Samsara, you’ll be splitting your time across two major focus areas; (1) supporting senior-level sellers in an attempt to grow existing customers, or win new customers, and (2) contributing to the SE Team as a senior resource. There is an expectation that an Enterprise SE is highly accountable for each technical sale, meaning that strong storytelling, objection handling, custom workarounds, advanced integrations, and extensive hands-on experience are requirements to win most deals. Takeaways from these activities should be shared across the SE Team via team meetings, messaging tools, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, an Enterprise Sales Engineer is accountable for carving out time to source and deliver product information, conduct testing of alpha products/features, manage projects, and build process improvements and automation that will scale the broader SE Team. An Enterprise Sales Engineer will still carry a quota, so a successful Enterprise Sales Engineer will possess excellent time management skills and will maintain a clear focus on retiring quota in addition to these other senior responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a remote position open to candidates residing in the United States except for San Francisco Bay Metros, New York City Metro and Washington DC Metro . This position requires travel up to 50% of the time and proximity to an international airport is preferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should apply if:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You want to impact the industries that run our world: Your efforts will result in real-world impact—helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have innate curiosity in how businesses work: One day you’ll meet with someone in waste management and the next you may be learning about the inner workings of a food distribution center. Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You build genuine relationships with your customers: The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You want to be with the best: Samsara’s high-performance culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a team player: At Samsara, sales is a team sport. We help each other out by sharing best practices and focus on winning as a team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this role, you will:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct product demonstrations and facilitate live proof-of-concept trials for prospective customers, and ensure these prospects understand - and are fully utilizing - the Samsara platform.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with Product Management, and other relevant teams, to help develop the Samsara platform.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate the value proposition of Samsara’s products and services along with the platform&#39;s core capabilities on-site, remotely via webinar sessions, or at field events such as conferences and trade shows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Respond to functional and technical elements of RFIs/RFPs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have the ability to be organized and analytical, and eliminate sales obstacles using creative and adaptive approaches.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate comfort working for a dynamic technical organization with a fast-growing partner and customer base.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remain highly available to Sales and cross-functional teams, making a measurable impact on Sales and product development in your region, and contributing to SE Team enablement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be a dynamic contributor on both Sales and SE Team internal communications channels.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Champion, role model, and embed Samsara’s cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum requirements for the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s of Science degree from a 4-year accredited university&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years of experience working with customers in a pre-sales technical role, customer success, or customer/product support capacity (Sales Engineer, Systems Engineer, Solutions Engineer, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to influence stakeholders based on your technical sales acumen and a solid understanding of business processes and change management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Previous experience managing hardware and/or software product evaluations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basic understanding of electronics and electrical systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with the following concepts: technical consulting, cloud software, cloud-connected hardware, computer networking, business systems integration, automation and control systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of various integration standards and transports (XML, REST, SOAP, EDI, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience integrating with RESTful APIs between SaaS applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exposure to various SaaS-based integrations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must be located within and authorized to work in the United States&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An ideal candidate also has:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s of Science degree or advanced education in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, or related discipline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work experience in task automation scripting and transferring data between systems using Bash, Python, JavaScript, or equivalent languageWork experience building solutions leveraging open API’s&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of vehicle diagnostic systems, including Controller Area Networks (CAN bus) and Power Take Off (PTO) applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hobbyist interest in working with things driven by electronic systems (car audio installation/classic car restoration, home automation, building things with raspberry pi, arduino, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consistent track record of success selling complex technical solutions through strategic sales cycles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;The range of annual on-target earnings (OTE) range for full-time employees for this position is below.
