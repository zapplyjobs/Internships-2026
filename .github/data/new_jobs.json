Discover more at www.asteralabs.com. About the Role We are seeking a Performance Analysis Engineer to drive system-level performance optimization across large-scale AI training and inference environments. In this role, you will analyze, profile, and optimize distributed workloads running on high-density accelerator clusters, working across the full stack, from ML frameworks and communication libraries to network fabrics and hardware architecture. You will play a critical role in ensuring that next-generation AI workloads achieve near-peak hardware efficiency, while directly influencing software architecture, infrastructure design, and future silicon and networking roadmaps. Job Duties Cluster-Scale Performance Profiling Execute and profile state-of-the-art training and inference workloads (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models) across large-scale accelerator clusters. Identify and resolve bottlenecks across compute, memory bandwidth, and interconnect latency that impact end-to-end Job Completion Time (JCT). Collective Library Optimization Tune and optimize distributed communication backends such as NCCL, RCCL, and MPI. Improve efficiency of collective operations including All-Reduce, All-to-All, Reduce-Scatter, and broadcast to minimize synchronization overhead. Network Fabric Analysis Conduct deep-dive analysis of network performance, diagnosing issues such as packet loss, congestion, head-of-line blocking, and tail latency. Partner with infrastructure teams to improve network behavior under real-world AI workloads.

Prevent network and compute “hot spots” in high-density AI clusters and improve workload fairness and throughput. PyTorch Stack Optimization Leverage advanced PyTorch capabilities including DistributedDataParallel (DDP), Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), and torch.compile. Optimize execution graphs, runtime traces, and memory usage for maximum hardware efficiency. GPU & Accelerator Utilization Apply best practices in kernel fusion, mixed-precision execution (FP16/FP8/INT8), and memory management. Reduce idle “bubble” time and drive sustained peak FLOPS utilization during training and inference. Performance Modeling & Benchmarking Build automated benchmarking suites and performance regression tests. Develop quantitative models to predict how architectural changes (e.g., attention mechanisms, batch sizes, parallelism strategies) scale across different cluster topologies. Hardware–Software Co-Design Collaborate closely with systems, infrastructure, and silicon teams to translate performance findings into actionable requirements. Influence the design of next-generation AI accelerators, NICs, and interconnects. Requirements & Qualifications Education:Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or a related field. Hands-on experience optimizing distributed ML workloads across multi-node accelerator clusters. Strong understanding of data parallelism, model parallelism, and pipeline parallelism. Deep knowledge of GPU or accelerator architectures, including compute units, memory hierarchies, and interconnects (PCIe, NVLink, or equivalents). Experience working with NCCL, RCCL, MPI, or similar collective communication frameworks. Strong understanding of high-performance networking (Ethernet, InfiniBand, RoCE) and their impact on distributed workloads. PyTorch & ML Systems Proficiency Advanced experience with PyTorch, including distributed training internals and execution tracing. Ability to diagnose and optimize framework-level and runtime bottlenecks. Comfortable debugging issues across software, firmware, and hardware boundaries. Strong proficiency in Python and C/C++.

Part of the drug development pipeline in DevSci includes the preclinical safety evaluation of candidate therapeutic molecules by toxicologists and pathologists in the Translational Safety (TS) department in order to enable further evaluation in humans. Translational Safety is an integral part of DevSci. We contribute to the organization’s success by providing scientific insights and ensuring the safety of molecules that advance through the pipeline to patients. We do this to support the DevSci vision to deliver the right drug in the right dose to the right patient. We are also committed to providing better outcomes for our people, patients, business, and communities by advancing and boldly championing diversity, equity, and inclusion in our work.Translational Safety’s Vision: We revolutionize and accelerate drug development through cutting-edge predictive, translational sciences.Translational Safety’s Mission: We develop transformative therapeutics for patients by delivering rigorous translational strategies and model-informed predictive insights for all therapeutic modalities through the entire drug development lifecycle via innovative experimental and computational approaches.The Translational Safety organization is composed of several integrated sub-functions. This summer intern project falls within the Computational Toxicology sub-function. The Computational Toxicology group enables early and accurate compound safety profiling by leveraging all relevant data (in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo), advanced analytics and computational modeling while closely working with other Translational Safety subfunctions such as Investigative Toxicology and Complex In Vitro Systems and a few subfunctions within gRED Computational Sciences Center of Excellence (CS CoE) organization.This internship position is located in South San Francisco, on-site.The OpportunityThe Computational Toxicology group is seeking a talented summer intern who could expand the current capabilities of an internally developed LLM-powered AI agent which involves development a critical new module that enables the agent to access and query the non-clinical in vivo toxicity data in SEND format using natural language which includes not only raw data but also text-mined test-article related findings from study reports.The primary technical objective is to implement a robust Text-to-SQL framework where the LLM, equipped with full awareness of the database schema, translates natural language questions into executable SQL queries.Beyond standard retrieval, the agent must possess chemical intelligence to interpret and execute complex tasks including but not limited to chemical similarity and substructure searches.The overarching goal is to democratize access to our extensive non-clinical data, specifically benefiting toxicologists, pathologists, and predictive toxicology scientists. By recognizing patterns within the wealth of in vivo data, the tool will assist users in comprehending compound toxicity across disparate studies, aggregating data for predictive modeling, and identifying test articles sharing specific substructures linked to specific adverse events.Program HighlightsIntensive 12-weeks, full-time (40 hours per week) paid internship.Program start dates are in May/June 2026.A stipend, based on location, will be provided to help alleviate costs associated with the internship. Ownership of challenging and impactful business-critical projects.Work with some of the most talented people in the biotechnology industry.Who You Are (Required)Required Education: You meet one of the following criteria:Must be pursuing a Master's Degree (enrolled student).Must have attained a Master's Degree.Must be pursuing a PhD (enrolled student).Required Majors: Computer Science, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, Computational Toxicology, Machine Learning & AI, Data Science or related fields.Required Skills:Advanced Python: Strong proficiency in Python for data manipulation and backend development.Database Expertise: Deep understanding of relational databases and the ability to write and optimize complex SQL queries.Generative AI & NLP: Experience working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to interface with structured data.Other: Good communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills.Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and QualificationsExcellent communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills.Complements our culture and the standards that guide our daily behavior & decisions: Integrity, Courage, and Passion.Chemoinformatics: Familiarity with chemistry toolkits like RDKit and concepts such as molecular fingerprinting or substructure searching.Scientific Data Standards: Knowledge of the SEND format or experience handling clinical/non-clinical study data.Problem Solving: A desire to work at the intersection of life sciences and AI to solve real-world drug safety challenges.Relocation benefits are not available for this job posting. The expected salary range for this position based on the primary location of California is $50.00 hour.
