Regularly update and refine the dashboards to reflect current business priorities and challenges, enabling teams to make informed decisions and proactively address potential issues related to card network mandates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Mandate Intake Process: &lt;/strong&gt;Oversee the network mandate intake process, ensuring timely review, assessment, and prioritization of mandates. Lead the proactive management of waiver requests, liaising between compliance and operational teams for resolution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage with External Partners: &lt;/strong&gt;Actively engage with external network partners by participating in councils, forums, and regular strategic meetings.
