Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard team ensures Stripe works seamlessly for every merchant—regardless of how their business is structured or which products they use. Our goal is to make Stripe feel like it was built just for them. While this role is aligned to our Dashboard team, it also sits within our centralized Content Design org—a team of writers, strategists, and sense-makers who work across Stripe to bring clarity to our users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You likely already call yourself a content designer, UX writer, information architect, or content strategist. In this role, you’ll shape the strategic direction of high-impact projects, in addition to crafting elegant interface copy that distills complex concepts into clear, actionable language. Content designers at Stripe are empowered to dive deeply into a problem space, pairing closely with product designers as equal partners in the product development process. Day to day, you’ll work with small, iterative cross-functional teams while enjoying the camaraderie and support of a centralized Content Design team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead content design for new product experiences that connect business goals with user needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scope and prioritize work, ensuring we’re working on the right things to achieve business goals and improve users’ experiences&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Present work regularly to leaders; synthesize and act on feedback to rapidly refine solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shape (and scribe) interaction flows, information architecture, and other microcopy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define, map, and name concepts across our product&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facilitate content critiques and workshops, advise partners on content execution, and create tools and templates to enable others to create their own great content&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make connections with product teams across Stripe to create cohesive user experiences and improve our design systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Champion craft and product excellence through example&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.
