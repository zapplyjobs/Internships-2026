Our engineers do it all, from meeting with customers to solving complex distributed systems problems. We do whatever it takes to solve our users’ most urgent needs. You will learn how to distill product requirements, write design docs, and build complex software, shoulder to shoulder with the best engineers in the industry. Our previous Co-Ops have built mission-critical features, such as detecting when planes are diverted or alerting when a scheduled route is expected to hit turbulence. What we value: Passionate Builders - We’re looking for talented engineers who love to build. Building isn’t a job, it’s a lifestyle. Our stack includes Python, Rust, and React — whether you already know them or are eager to learn, you’ll thrive if you love solving hard problems and shipping great products.
