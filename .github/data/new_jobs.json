You'll work side by side with some of the smartest people in the business on assignments that matter. So here we are. You have a lot to learn. We have a lot to do. It's the perfect storm. Join us to start Caring. Connecting. Growing together.\n\nAt UnitedHealth Group, you will join a community-based, multi-specialty organization where you will work with talented peers on a common purpose: improving the quality, cost, and experience of health care. Here, we focus on delivering the best patient care, rather than volume. Through innovation and superior care management, we support patients and your well-being as a team member. Join a team at the forefront of value-based care and discover the meaning behind.\n\nThe Nursing Internship Program is full-time, 40 hours per week for 10 weeks starting June 2, 2026.\n\nThis role requires travel to patients' homes within a designated territory in either Jefferson County or Central County.

Under the supervision of our RNs and providers, you will learn how to:\n• Engage members / families in their homes or in a facility to coordinate services, community resources and treatment\n• Travel in assigned territory to complete member assessments; the rest of the time will be spent working in a home-based office\n• Deliver coordinated holistic care based on the member's needs using a patient centric approach\n• Identify early risk factors and conduct ongoing assessments and document in electronic patient files\n• Create, review and revise care plans and focus on a holistic approach\n• Function as an advocate for members\n• Collaborate with the member's PCP to deliver and coordinate necessary services\n• Build relationships with members and their families, assisting them with coordination of health choices\n• Ensure all patient assignments and corresponding interventions are documented in a timely manner\n• Coordinate with other state agencies, community resources and providers\n\nYou'll be rewarded and recognized for your performance in an environment that will challenge you and give you clear direction on what it takes to succeed in your role as well as provide development for other roles you may be interested in.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n• Currently enrolled in, or recently graduated from, an accredited RN Bachelor's Degree program, with graduation expected within 12 months of the internship start date (before or after)\n• 2+ years of LVN/LPN experience, ADN experience, or other previous experience in healthcare\n• Current Basic Life Support (BLS) certification\n• Must be available to work full-time, 40 hours per week during the duration of the summer internship program (from June 2 - August 7)\n• Must be eligible to work in the US without company sponsorship, now or in the future, for employment-based work authorization (F-1 students with practical training and candidates requiring H-1Bs, TNs, etc will not be considered)\n• Access to reliable transportation that will enable you to travel to community centers, facilities, community activities, or patient homes across a designated territory\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• 3.0 or higher cumulative GPA\n• Demonstrated oral and written communication skills\n• Knowledge of clinical terminology\n\nPay is based on several factors including but not limited to local labor markets, education, work experience, certifications, etc. In addition to your salary, we offer benefits such as, a comprehensive benefits package, incentive and recognition programs, equity stock purchase and 401k contribution (all benefits are subject to eligibility requirements). No matter where or when you begin a career with us, you'll find a far-reaching choice of benefits and incentives. The hourly pay for this role will range from $18.00 to $24.00 per hour based on full-time employment.

We believe everyone-of every race, gender, sexuality, age, location and income-deserves the opportunity to live their healthiest life. Today, however, there are still far too many barriers to good health which are disproportionately experienced by people of color, historically marginalized groups and those with lower incomes. We are committed to mitigating our impact on the environment and enabling and delivering equitable care that addresses health disparities and improves health outcomes - an enterprise priority reflected in our mission.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer under applicable law and qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a drug - free workplace.
