As part of a recently public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our Platform is the foundation of our Connected Operations solution. Think of it as a hub-and-spoke model. All our products — safety, route planning, maintenance, fuel efficiency, EV reporting etc — are the spokes that engage users. But they all connect back to the central hub.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most organizational platforms — and we&#39;re talking about those outside of Samsara — act as a software layer between infrastructure and product. They also tend to function behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our platform, however, is different. Not only do we work on core infrastructure and platform components, we also develop customer-facing features. Customers log into Samsara through the platform, interacting with everything from the login screen to dashboards, reports, settings, and alerts. Regardless of the product, the platform is the central interface for insights and management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Senior Software Engineer in the Platform team, you’ll own the systems you build, shape products that prevent crashes and emissions, and create world-class systems at scale. You’ll take full technical ownership of key product areas used by thousands of fleets worldwide, solving real-world problems that cut CO₂ and keep people safe. Your ideas will shape roadmaps, influence critical decisions, and power products that make measurable impact at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work with product managers, designers, firmware and infrastructure engineers to design, build, test, and deliver end-to-end products. You’ll develop skills across multiple technologies and own the production systems in your domain. You will coach, mentor, and guide engineers in the team, while also receiving support for your own development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a remote position open to candidates residing in the US or Canada.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should apply if:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You want to impact the industries that run our world: The software, firmware, and hardware you build will result in real-world impact, helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You want to build for scale: With over 2.3 million IoT devices deployed to our global customers, you will work on a range of new and mature technologies, driving scalable innovation for customers across industries, driving the world&#39;s physical operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a lifelong learner: We have ambitious goals. Every Samsarian has a growth mindset as we work with a wide range of technologies, challenges, and customers that push us to learn on the go.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You believe customers are more than a number: Samsara engineers enjoy a rare closeness to the end user, and you will have the opportunity to participate in customer interviews, collaborate with customer success and product managers, and use metrics to ensure our work is translating into better customer outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a team player: Working on our Samsara Engineering teams requires a mix of independent effort and collaboration.
