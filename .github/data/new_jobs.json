Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. By the Numbers: Named #1 best software for small business of 2024 by G2 2,700+ employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Turkiye and growing Over $500M in annual revenue The SMB market is large (and growing!) with huge opportunities for Gusto to make an incredible impact for SMBs There are 6.2M employers in the US, 98% have fewer than 100 employees (1) 550,000 new businesses are created each year in the US (1) What Product Management is like at Gusto: We’re looking for high-autonomy, entrepreneurial Product Managers to build high-impact solutions for small businesses and their employees. We believe in high-ownership Product Managers who operate like business owners — owning an entire roadmap end to end and shipping product all the way from strategy through to the nitty-gritty details (some describe this kind of role as a “GM” type role). Our Product team is lean, which means you’ll have a high degree of impact and ownership. We believe in smaller, empowered teams that move quickly with less overhead. You’ll move fast by pairing sharp product judgment with fluency in AI tools — automating what slows teams down and amplifying what makes them creative and high-performing. We’re boundaryless builders. Lines between roles are intentionally blurred, and our PMs do whatever it takes to deliver outcomes. You’ll prototype, automate, design, and ship — using AI as your co-builder to turn problems into durable solutions that deliver customer value with urgency and care. We’re here to serve small and medium businesses. Gusto has a strong mission-driven culture, and we care deeply about lifting up these business owners — building technology for an AI-first world that gives them the superpowers to run and grow their businesses with confidence. We’re comfortable with change. Our environment moves fast, and PMs here thrive in ambiguity — blending curiosity, experimentation, and AI-native craft to shape how products (and work itself) are built at Gusto. About the Team: Gusto Solo is our newest product offering, designed to help solopreneurs seamlessly pay themselves and manage their businesses — all in one compliant, easy-to-use intelligent platform. As the Principal Product Manager, you’ll chart the course for Gusto Solo’s next phase of growth. With the MVP now live, this role is about scaling — shaping the vision, deepening product-market fit, and unlocking new, AI-powered opportunities for solopreneurs. You’ll collaborate closely with a fully staffed, high-performing cross-functional team that’s passionate about serving this customer base. This is a critical role — your work will directly shape one of Gusto’s key growth drivers and define what an AI-first customer experience looks like for millions of small business owners. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Own the vision and strategy. Set the long-term direction for Gusto Solo — defining the big problems we can solve well and building toward durable competitive advantage. You’ll do this by continuously uncovering and deeply understanding customer needs, testing risky assumptions, running lean experiments, and staying close to trends and the market environment as the product evolves toward product–market fit. Collaborate and influence. Partner across every function — Engineering, Design, Data Science, Service Delivery, Marketing, Finance, and more — to bring your bold vision to life. You’ll rally cross-functional teams and leaders around a shared strategy, building alignment and momentum to make that vision a reality. Make it happen. Be the pace setter. Drive execution as a boundariless builder — doing whatever it takes to achieve outcomes. You will use AI as your co-builder to turn complex problems into durable, customer-loved solutions with urgency and care. Here’s what we're looking for: 8+ years of hands-on Product Management experience Proven track record of building 0→1 products and scaling them into their next chapter of high growth. You’re a builder at heart — entrepreneurial, curious, fluent, and stay up to date AI tools that help you move faster and think bigger. You’ve built or scaled AI-first products (whether at work or on your own) and see AI as a co-builder that expands what’s possible. Experienced in building with modern AI systems — from prompting and fine-tuning to evaluating outputs and shipping reliable, user-facing experiences . Experience building and scaling products in high growth startups and highly regulated domains (e.g., Fintech, Accounting, Taxes, Payroll) — you understand how to design systems that are both compliant and customer-obsessed. GTM excellence — you’ve partnered with Marketing to craft promise→payoff, pricing/packaging, and lifecycle activation strategies that drive adoption and retention. Exceptional collaboration and storytelling. You build trust quickly, drive alignment across teams, and communicate a compelling vision that inspires action. If you don't think you meet all of the criteria above but still are interested in the job, please apply. Nobody checks every box, and we're looking for someone excited to join the team. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $179,000/yr to $224,000/yr in Denver & most major metro locations, and $210,000/yr to $263,000/yr for San Francisco, Seattle & New York. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate location, experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. Where do PMs at Gusto work? We have offices in Denver, San Francisco, and New York and have remote team members across the US and Canada. We are also actively hiring for the following hubs: Toronto, Canada, Los Angeles, CA, and Seattle, WA.

We believe in high-ownership Product Managers who operate like business owners — owning an entire roadmap end to end and shipping product all the way from strategy through to the nitty-gritty details (some describe this kind of role as a “GM” type role).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our Product team is lean, which means you’ll have a high degree of impact and ownership. We believe in smaller, empowered teams that move quickly with less overhead. You’ll move fast by pairing sharp product judgment with fluency in AI tools — automating what slows teams down and amplifying what makes them creative and high-performing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We’re boundaryless builders. Lines between roles are intentionally blurred, and our PMs do whatever it takes to deliver outcomes. You’ll prototype, automate, design, and ship — using AI as your co-builder to turn problems into durable solutions that deliver customer value with urgency and care.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We’re here to serve small and medium businesses. Gusto has a strong mission-driven culture, and we care deeply about lifting up these business owners — building technology for an AI-first world that gives them the superpowers to run and grow their businesses with confidence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We’re comfortable with change. Our environment moves fast, and PMs here thrive in ambiguity — blending curiosity, experimentation, and AI-native craft to shape how products (and work itself) are built at Gusto.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gusto.com/product/solutions/size/solo&quot;&gt;Gusto Solo&lt;/a&gt; is our newest product offering, designed to help solopreneurs seamlessly pay themselves and manage their businesses — all in one compliant, easy-to-use intelligent platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Principal Product Manager, you’ll chart the course for Gusto Solo’s next phase of growth. With the MVP now live, this role is about scaling — shaping the vision, deepening product-market fit, and unlocking new, AI-powered opportunities for solopreneurs. You’ll collaborate closely with a fully staffed, high-performing cross-functional team that’s passionate about serving this customer base. This is a critical role — your work will directly shape one of Gusto’s key growth drivers and define what an AI-first customer experience looks like for millions of small business owners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own the vision and strategy. &lt;/strong&gt;Set the long-term direction for Gusto Solo — defining the big problems we can solve well and building toward durable competitive advantage. You’ll do this by continuously uncovering and deeply understanding customer needs, testing risky assumptions, running lean experiments, and staying close to trends and the market environment as the product evolves toward product–market fit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate and influence.&lt;/strong&gt; Partner across every function — Engineering, Design, Data Science, Service Delivery, Marketing, Finance, and more — to bring your bold vision to life. You’ll rally cross-functional teams and leaders around a shared strategy, building alignment and momentum to make that vision a reality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it happen.&lt;/strong&gt; Be the pace setter. Drive execution as a boundariless builder — doing whatever it takes to achieve outcomes. You will use AI as your co-builder to turn complex problems into durable, customer-loved solutions with urgency and care.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what we&#39;re looking for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;8+ years of hands-on Product Management experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven track record of building 0→1 products and scaling them into their next chapter of high growth.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re a builder at heart — entrepreneurial, curious, fluent, and stay up to date AI tools that help you move faster and think bigger. You’ve built or scaled AI-first products (whether at work or on your own) and see AI as a co-builder that expands what’s possible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experienced in building with modern AI systems — from prompting and fine-tuning to evaluating outputs and shipping reliable, user-facing experiences .&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building and scaling products in high growth startups and highly regulated domains (e.g., Fintech, Accounting, Taxes, Payroll) — you understand how to design systems that are both compliant and customer-obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GTM excellence — you’ve partnered with Marketing to craft promise→payoff, pricing/packaging, and lifecycle activation strategies that drive adoption and retention.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional collaboration and storytelling. You build trust quickly, drive alignment across teams, and communicate a compelling vision that inspires action.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don&#39;t think you meet all of the criteria above but still are interested in the job, please apply. Nobody checks every box, and we&#39;re looking for someone excited to join the team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our cash compensation amount for this role is $179,000/yr to $224,000/yr in Denver &amp;amp; most major metro locations, and $210,000/yr to $263,000/yr for San Francisco, Seattle &amp;amp; New York.

With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. Head of Sales Compensation - GTM Location: San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Atlanta, Phoenix, or Las Vegas. Candidates located in San Francisco, Denver, or NYC are expected to be in office two days a week. About the Role: As the Head of Sales Compensation at Gusto, you will be a key leader and strategic advisor to our Sales leadership teams, reporting into the Head of Revenue Operations. You will own the end-to-end strategy, design, and operationalization of all incentive compensation plans across our Sales organizations. This is a dynamic role where you'll apply your experience, analytical skills, and passion for sales to ensure our compensation programs are competitive, fair, and aligned with our ambitious growth objectives. You'll partner closely with leadership across Sales, RevOps, Finance, and People to successfully attract, motivate, and retain top talent. You will also directly lead a team of Sales Compensation Analysts. What You'll Do: Strategic Leadership & Execution: Act as a strategic thought partner to GTM/Sales and Finance leaders on incentive strategy and plan design. You'll not only develop a clear compensation vision but also possess the operational chops to execute on it. This includes rolling up your sleeves to troubleshoot issues, building robust operational mechanisms, and partnering with Sales Ops and other systems teams to solve problems as they arise. Program Ownership: Lead the full lifecycle of sales compensation, from annual and semi-annual planning and plan design (curves, components, weightings) to implementation (using platforms like Xactly and SFDC), training, and daily administration. Team Leadership: Empower a team of Sales Compensation Analysts, fostering a collaborative and high-performing environment. Operational Excellence: Drive efficiency and accuracy by documenting, optimizing, and automating processes for quotas, crediting, attainment reporting, and resolving disputes. Establish clear cadences for planning and reviews. Compliance & Governance: Design, implement, and monitor compensation process controls to ensure internal compliance and educate cross-functional partners on the rationale behind key business decisions. Performance & Analytics: Track and report on the effectiveness of compensation programs, monitoring key metrics such as budget adherence, error rates, and program ROI to ensure we're achieving desired outcomes. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partner with GTM/Sales, Sales Ops, Finance, and People teams to enhance sales engagement and productivity through effective compensation, helping to recruit and retain the best talent. What We’re Looking For: Experience: 10+ years of experience in sales compensation design and operationalization, with at least 3+ years in a leadership role within a SaaS environment. Analytical Skills: A dynamic leader with exceptional analytical abilities. You are just as comfortable leading the strategic design of a program as you are with the hands-on implementation and administration of daily processes. Technical Expertise: Proven experience in analyzing and optimizing compensation plans and processes. Proficiency with Salesforce (SFDC) and a compensation management tool like Xactly is required. Communication & Influence: A persuasive communicator who uses data to tell a story and back up recommendations. You can influence leadership, inspire team members to think big, and flex naturally between high-level strategy and rolling up your sleeves to get things done. Problem-Solving Mindset: You are passionate about sales and creatively find ways to make teams more productive. You thrive in high-growth, fast-paced environments where things move quickly and processes are constantly evolving. Adaptable & Detail-Oriented: You are hyper-organized with strong attention to detail. Effective stakeholder and project management are part of your core skill set. Our annual base salary compensation range for this role is $238,00 - 297,500 in San Francisco & New York, and $202,000 - $252,500 in Denver and most other remote locations.

We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: As the Head of Revenue Analytics at Gusto, you will lead a critical function responsible for using data to measure, analyze, and optimize the drivers of our Go-to-Market revenue. Reporting to the Head of Revenue Operations, you will be a strategic partner to our GTM and Product teams, using a deep understanding of customer behavior and market trends to drive growth, retention, and profitability. You will lead a team of Gusties responsible for revenue forecasting, marketing analytics, and customer expansion insights, working cross-functionally with Sales, Marketing, Finance, Data, and Product to guide Gusto’s growth strategy. The ideal candidate is an exceptional data leader who can balance strategic vision with hands-on analytical work — someone equally comfortable shaping forecasts at the executive level and rolling up their sleeves to build reports or run ad-hoc analyses when needed. What You'll Do: Strategic Leadership: Develop and execute a comprehensive revenue analytics strategy that aligns with GTM’s overall business goals. Partner with GTM and R&D leaders to provide the data and insights needed to make informed, data-driven decisions. Forecasting & Planning: Lead the design and execution of revenue forecasts across acquisition, expansion, and retention. Provide Finance and GTM leaders with accurate, transparent, and actionable views of performance. Marketing Analytics: Drive analysis of acquisition efficiency, ROI, attribution, and customer lifecycle value to optimize spend and guide strategic bets. Customer & Retention Insights: Deliver churn, retention, and CLV analysis to inform strategies for engagement, upsell, and long-term profitability. Insights and Recommendations: Conduct deep-dive analyses to identify revenue drivers and anomalies. Translate complex data into clear, actionable insights and recommendations for senior leadership and cross-functional partners. Quota & Budget Alignment: Partner with Finance and GTM leaders to support quota setting, budget allocation, and performance tracking. Data Products & Infrastructure: Build and scale datasets, dashboards, and tools that provide self-serve access to revenue insights while ensuring data quality and consistency. AI-Driven Analytics: Evaluate and apply AI/ML techniques to enhance forecasting, attribution, and customer lifecycle modeling. Stay ahead of emerging AI tools that can drive efficiency and accuracy in revenue analytics. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Serve as a critical partner to Sales Ops, GTM Analytics, Marketing Ops, and Finance in aligning data and insights across the funnel. People Empowerment: Recruit, mentor, and develop a high-performing analytics team. Foster a culture of curiosity, analytical rigor, and operational excellence to deliver impact across the business. What We’re Looking For: 12+ years of experience in analytics, forecasting, or revenue strategy, with at least 5+ years in a leadership role. Leadership with a Builder Mindset: A dynamic leader who inspires and develops teams while maintaining a “roll up your sleeves” attitude — able to step into the details when needed to build reports, run analyses, and troubleshoot. Analytical Expertise: Strong analytical skills with expertise in data analysis and visualization tools (e.g., SQL, Tableau, Power BI). Experience with financial and marketing forecasting models. SaaS/Growth Background: Proven track record of successfully building and leading analytics functions in a high-growth SaaS or technology environment. Technical Skills: Familiarity with various data sources and technologies, including Salesforce, marketing automation platforms, and data warehouses. AI Fluency: Awareness of how AI/ML is transforming analytics, with the ability to partner with data science and engineering teams to pilot and operationalize AI-driven approaches. Skilled at discerning when AI adds value and when traditional methods are more appropriate. Business Acumen: Deep understanding of the entire customer lifecycle, from acquisition to retention, and how each stage impacts revenue. Communication & Influence: Excellent communication and presentation skills with the ability to distill complex data into clear, actionable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences. Compensation Our annual base salary compensation range for this role is $201,200 - $251,500 in San Francisco & New York, and $171,200 - $214,000 in Denver. This role is also eligible for an annual variable cash bonus (up to 20%).
