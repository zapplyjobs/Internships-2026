The team&#39;s reach is widespread across Stripe, not exclusive to one sales segment or geographical region; GBS drives change across go-to-market, positively impacting Stripe users and cross-functional teams.

Product Marketing is a highly cross-functional role at Stripe, partnering closely with Product and Engineering, Sales, Partnerships, Demand Generation and Campaigns to name a few. Different from many other Product Marketing teams, our team works across the entire product lifecycle, from helping shape the product, to driving launch and commercialization, to growing product adoption post-launch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Demo Engineer to build the on‑stage product demos that anchor our product announcement keynotes at &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/sessions/2025&quot;&gt;Sessions&lt;/a&gt;, our annual user conference, and our global Stripe Tour event series. This role sits at the intersection of engineering, product, comms, and marketing. Partnering closely with product teams across the organization, you’ll own the keynote demos for our most exciting product launches, end to end—from concept and architecture to polish and rehearsals—so they’re technically flawless and narratively unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demo ownership and storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own the creation of all keynote demos (code and dashboard) across Stripe’s portfolio, from concept to live delivery, ensuring each demo maps to the keynote narrative and business goals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Product and Engineering to scope each demo: define technical requirements, dependencies, and success criteria; storyboard flows that showcase the key details of each product.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with PMM, Comms, and Product to align each demo to key story beats in the keynote script.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical architecture and engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Architect and build robust demo apps and environments (frontend, backend, services, data pipelines).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sweat the details: configure environments, provision accounts, set realistic sample data, and wire integrations/webhooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build internal tooling and frameworks to accelerate and safeguard make demo production.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration and production support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Design and Marketing to craft clear, legible on‑screen moments and create supporting assets (screens, snippets, animations, backup videos).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Orchestrate demo rehearsals and run‑of‑show, and train our on-stage demoers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Travel to be onsite for flagship events (SF and NY) and key &lt;a href=&quot;https://tour.stripeevent.com/&quot;&gt;Tour&lt;/a&gt; events; support live ops during show days, including non‑standard hours.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Minimum Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years in software engineering (or equivalent).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in demo engineering, solutions architecture, sales engineering, or developer relations is a plus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Payments/fintech, AV/show production familiarity, and hardware/POS experience are nice to have.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexibility. Willing to travel (20–30%) and support non‑standard hours around major events.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Preferred Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An engineer–storyteller.

You have experience integrating Stripe or other RESTful APIs into web applications, and can quickly build high quality demos that meet our standards of craft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reliability‑obsessed. You design for live demos with fallbacks and risk mitigation in mind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Structured and strategic. You create storyboards, technical specs, and checklists; you manage version control and environments with discipline; you bring order to fast, high‑stakes work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Calm under pressure. You’ve supported live demos or launches and keep your cool when something unexpected happens; you think in contingencies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborative. You work seamlessly with Product, Eng, PMM, Design, Comms, and show production; strong stakeholder management and clear communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Organized.

The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe’s front door surfaces, educating customers about the power of our platform, sharing Stripe’s ideas and expertise with the public, and driving adoption. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to update.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Together we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe’s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer you will concept, prototype, and build new experiences for our web presence. You’ll build new tools and experiences to illustrate the value of Stripe’s products. You’ll often craft individual experiences or animations that distill a complex topic into a simple concept, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/checkout&quot;&gt;stripe.com/checkout&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll constantly consider in-browser performance, SEO and discoverability, and accessibility. You’ll both use existing components and create new ones for other designers and engineers to consume and build upon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Design Engineers in WPP have a shared commitment to user experience and craft, but each pod has subtly different focus areas. The Collective pod leverages design, animation, and interaction to drive awareness, educate prospective users, and share Stripe’s expertise across public surfaces such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/sessions&quot;&gt;Stripe Sessions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe Press&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.com/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;. The Expansion pod brings the same creativity and executional rigor to attracting new prospects and driving conversion, focusing on user journeys, interactive and highly polished tools for users, and building targeted experiences for our global users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer on the Expansion pod, you will bring a high standard for creativity and execution to a variety of high-impact opportunities. You will reimagine the user experience moments that contribute to acquisition journeys. You will build delightful and original interactive tools and resources that attract users. You will collaborate deeply across design, engineering, and cross-functional teams and work across teams and tech stacks to create new site capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with our team’s designers and partners to prototype, implement, and maintain dynamic interactive tools and experiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with other design engineers, pairing, mentoring, and continually building a culture of excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain and extend our design systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build high-polish web pages that meet high standards for SEO, accessibility, and performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We&#39;re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

    "description": "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Stripe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone&#39;s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Web Presence and Platform is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe&#39;s public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe’s front door surfaces, educating customers about the power of our platform, sharing Stripe’s ideas and expertise with the public, and driving adoption. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to update.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Together we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe’s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer you will concept, prototype, and build new experiences for our web presence. You’ll bring your creativity and expertise to the full range of the Stripe brand, across evergreen pages as well as time-based campaigns. You’ll both utilize and contribute to our libraries and design systems, and when appropriate work outside established systems to create new digital moments.&amp;nbsp; You’ll constantly have in-browser performance in mind, and create abstractions that other designers and engineers consume and build upon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Design Engineers in WPP have a shared commitment to user experience and craft, but each pod has subtly different focus areas. The Collective pod leverages design, animation, and interaction to drive awareness, educate prospective users, and share Stripe’s expertise across public surfaces such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.com/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;, and others. The Expansion pod brings the same creativity and executional rigor to attracting new prospects and driving conversion, focusing on user journeys, interactive and highly polished tools for users, and building targeted experiences for our global users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer on the Collective pod, you will help us continue to drive &lt;a href=&quot;http://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe.com&lt;/a&gt; forward, bringing new experiences to life or refining existing content to inform prospective users about the company and its offerings. You will partner closely with designers, other engineers, and partners to execute and evolve the site, bringing technical craft and creativity to the expansive scope of Stripe’s web presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborate with our team’s designers and partners to both create new experiences for and maintain Stripe.com&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with other design engineers, pairing, mentoring, and continually building a culture of excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prototype and implement web animations and interaction-heavy product launch materials&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build beautiful, best-in-class end-user experiences to solve complex problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Utilize, maintain, and extend our design systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrate our web platform with self-serve authoring and experimentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We&#39;re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.
