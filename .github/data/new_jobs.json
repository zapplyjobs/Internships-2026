More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable is looking for a Senior Manager, Enterprise Marketing Programs to build and own our enterprise pipeline marketing engine. This role owns the vision and execution of systemically converting in-market signals into qualified sales conversations through experimental and robust marketing programs. What you'll do In this role, you'll create qualified sales pipeline through two complementary approaches: (1) building broad demand generation programs using solutions messaging to attract enterprise buyers at scale through channels like webinars, paid media, email, and events, and (2) hunting and activating high-propensity accounts by identifying product usage signals that indicate upgrade readiness. You will identify and engage existing Airtable champions with targeted programs—whether with relevant solutions, or expansion/upsell messaging. You'll design and execute these programs, partnering with sales on outbound plays, competitive campaigns, and new motions. This role requires someone who can both architect the strategy, execute the programs, and measure what's working—you'll own building the enterprise pipeline marketing engine from the ground up. That means running multiple programs simultaneously, partnering across teams (PMM, sales, creative, digital, events), drafting your own messaging and content to test, designing experiments to learn what converts, and making real-time decisions about where to invest. Experimentation is how you’ll learn fast and discover what drives enterprise revenue at scale. Core Responsibilities Generate qualified enterprise pipeline through integrated marketing programs aligned to Airtable's priority GTM plays Accelerate time-to-conversation by optimizing engagement models, messaging, and channel strategies across email, paid, events, and social Draft messaging, content, and creative briefs to test what converts—partnering with PMM, creative, and agencies to scale what works Convert product signals into enterprise opportunities by identifying and activating accounts showing enterprise characteristics through solutions-led programming Build the repeatable pipeline engine - design, test, and scale programs that systematically turn GTM plays into revenue Drive marketing-sales alignment by representing Demand Gen in cross-functional GTM meetings, partnering on outbound programs, and building tight feedback loops that improve targeting and performance Who you are Experience: 8-10+ years in B2B enterprise marketing with deep expertise in integrated program design and execution Strong understanding of PLG -> enterprise motions and proven track record generating measurable pipeline and revenue Experience with sales plays and outbound marketing motions. ABM experience a nice to have. Background working closely with product marketing on GTM launches and optimizing funnel metrics Experience with Airtable or similar no-code AI platforms; genuine enthusiasm for building with and using AI in your work Solutions marketing, vertical marketing, or PLG-to-Enterprise experience highly valued How You Work: Extremely independent operator who thrives in ambiguity Bias to action: you ship fast, learn fast, and iterate Experimental mindset: design tests, kill what doesn't work, double down on what does Takes extreme ownership—you design it, build it, run it, measure it, improve it Strong cross-functional collaboration skills; ability to influence without authority What Makes This Role Unique This isn't about running the playbook—it's about writing it in real-time. Airtable's PLG model generates thousands of high-intent product signals daily, and your job is to design the programs that convert those signals into enterprise pipeline at scale. You'll need to figure out what works, often with incomplete information, and be willing to scrap what doesn't. We're looking for someone who doesn't just market the product—you use it. If you're energized by building in the unknown, measure success in pipeline generated (not just programs launched), and move fast—this role is for you. Airtable is an equal opportunity employer.

More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.About the Role You own customer storytelling for Airtable with the strategic mindset of a product marketer. You identify compelling AI use cases, work directly with customers to extract their stories, and create detailed, demo-led content. You write the narrative, create the demo, and ensure every story teaches something specific. You're deeply curious—the kind of person who asks \"why did you build it that way?\" and \"what happens when X breaks?\" until you truly understand not just what the customer built, but why it matters and how it works.You’re looking to pioneer a new approach—customer stories, demos, testimonials, and use cases that show real people solving specific problems with working demos. Not corporate hand-waves, but real builders—by name, by role, by actual challenge—demonstrating their AI-powered Airtable implementations. Success in this role is not program management, it’s developing engaging content that positions our builders as AI leaders. What you'll do Customer Story Development & Execution Identify and qualify high-impact AI use cases solving real business problems at scale Conduct deep-dive customer interviews to understand workflows, challenges, and outcomes in detail, asking questions until you really understand Lead demo sessions where customers walk through their builds. Capture these sessions, then recreate them as working demos with anonymized data Write focused stories that go deep on problem, AI-powered solution, and measurable outcomes Produce demo videos—handle filming, basic editing, and scripting (partner with creative for high-production needs only) Use AI tools extensively to accelerate content creation—transcription, synthesis, drafting, editing Pipeline & Library Management Build and manage our customer story database from publication and beyond to event speaking, future references, and more Maintain searchable library tagged by use case, industry, AI features, company size, personas, story usage Coordinate with Sales, CS, and PMM to identify which stories support campaigns and sales plays Own insights and iteration using engagement usage and pipeline data to refine which stories we tell next Partner with demand generation on distribution plans Cross-Functional Storytelling Strategy Partner with PMM on customer stories supporting broader campaigns Package stories for field use with Sales Enablement Collaborate with Marketing, CS, and Value team on expansion stories and AI adoption patterns Support AR/PR with customer validation Work with Field Marketing & Events to identify and prepare customer speakers for virtual and live events Who you are You're a storyteller first, but technical enough to appreciate complexity. You can interview a customer, understand what they built, and translate it into a narrative that others strive to replicate. You use AI tools daily to transform how you work: transcription, synthesis, drafting, editing, research. You see AI as a force multiplier. You have strong opinions about what makes a customer story exceptional—accessible, credible, and outcome-driven. Your stories make it easy for others to see how they can apply the solution to their own work, backed by real results that inspire action. You're great at earning customer trust and managing executive time. Minimum Qualifications 5+ years in product marketing, customer marketing, or technical content at B2B SaaS companies Exceptional storytelling and writing for technical/business audiences Daily AI tool user—show us how you've used AI to accelerate your work Strong customer relationship skills and ability to extract stories through thoughtful questioning Autonomous operator—manage your pipeline, prioritize work, don't wait for direction Technical aptitude—learn platforms quickly and understand implementations Preferred Qualifications Portfolio of customer content you've personally created Demo-led, video-first, or interactive customer content experience Basic video production skills—comfortable filming, editing, adding graphics Airtable or similar platform expertise (no-code, automation, workflow tools) AI/ML product marketing or AI transformation content experience Customer content that Sales actively uses and credits with deal influence Airtable is an equal opportunity employer.
