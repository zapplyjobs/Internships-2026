Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/payments/link&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; helps Stripe’s merchants deliver frictionless and secure checkout experiences by auto-filling customers’ payment information. Link enables customers to checkout in just 6 seconds, increasing conversion rates for Stripe’s merchants by over 7%. Link is available on the sites of hundreds of thousands of merchants—customers can save payment info on any Link-supported site, and pay in one click across the Link merchant network. Link is built into merchants’ existing payments integrations on Stripe, with no additional charges or fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a Product Manager to lead the strategy and development of Link Balance — a foundational product that transforms Link from a one-click checkout into a global consumer financial platform. Link Balance is built on stablecoins, powered by Bridge and Privy, and distributed through Stripe’s network of 200 million consumers. Link Balance brings the borderless, programmable, and instant utility of digital dollars into everyday use. You’ll define how value is stored, surfaced, and spent across Link, designing experiences that make digital money feel as intuitive and safe as any other payment method. This is a 0 to 1 opportunity to help Stripe grow the GDP of the internet by building its native currency and shaping how digital dollars move through the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish the multi-year strategy for how stablecoins are stored, surfaced, and spent across Link, shaping both foundational infrastructure and consumer experiences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead discovery and experimentation to identify and prioritize the most impactful features and opportunities, making clear recommendations based on what drives the most value for consumers and merchants.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive product development and launch execution, scoping, coordinating, and shipping new capabilities in partnership with Engineering, Design, Treasury, Compliance, and Go-To-Market teams.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and manage cross-functional relationships across Stripe, Bridge, and Privy to ensure the balance model scales globally, integrates seamlessly into Stripe’s network, and upholds the highest standards of safety, compliance, and reliability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define and track success metrics for adoption, engagement, and reliability, using insights to iterate quickly, optimize user experience, and guide future roadmap decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

As stewards of Stripe’s massive monorepo, we operate at the frontiers of Git scalability, pushing the boundaries of what standard source code management systems can handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are currently at a pivotal moment in our infrastructure evolution.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The UX Research team is part of Stripe’s Design team and works across product and marketing initiatives at Stripe to more effectively and efficiently deliver products and experiences that fulfill user needs. And since Stripe’s main audience is other people who build products, we agonize over and take pride in crafting user-friendly and user-focused experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to conducting primary research, we also enable other Stripes (engineers, product managers, designers, marketers, sales, operations, etc.) to learn and apply research skills to global problems. You will play a role in shaping how we build research as a core competency across Stripe and define how we put users first when conducting research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Staff UX Researcher, you will be dedicated to the Payments team and collaborate directly with product, engineering, analytics, marketing, and design teams. The Payments team focuses on offering solutions that empower our merchants to achieve the most optimum payment performance by balancing regulatory requirements against conversion, costs, and fraud considerations. You will work on rich problem spaces such as understanding users’ preferences and needs of payments routing to evolve Stripe Orchestration, and shaping products to help businesses optimize payment margins. This would be an excellent opportunity for an experienced researcher who is interested in applying their craft to help build new product experiences that help businesses increase their revenue and lower their costs, across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead critical research efforts and complex, large-scale research programs that deepen our understanding of the user experience and drive company strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Promote a unified view of our customers and users and ensure their needs come first in everything we do&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure user needs and insights play a leading role in product strategy, shaping, and development decisions by working in a highly collaborative fashion with product, design, engineering, and marketing leaders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prioritize research needs and approaches across multiple teams and orgs to work on the right project, scale, and scope at the right time and ensure impact by delivering actionable insights&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enable other Stripes to learn and apply research skills by building research programs, platforms, and toolkits that empower them to conduct tactical research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with other researchers to build out Stripe’s research practice and infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Disseminate research insights to evolve and enhance Stripe’s understanding of user needs and identify innovative opportunities to meet those needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

You&#39;ve pioneered a new methodology, are an expert in a specific research application, or come with deep domain expertise&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can conduct complex research at scale and demonstrate the use of a variety of research methods, which may include qualitative interviews, surveys, ideation sessions, ethnographic field research, usability evaluation, and diary studies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can lead, design, execute, and communicate impactful research in a fast-paced, earlier stage product development process and know how to integrate research into product and design roadmaps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Has excellent written and verbal communication skills. Can distill research findings into clear, and compelling data-backed presentations, data visualizations, and/or infographics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can successfully set and achieve priorities that find the perfect balance between benefiting the project, the Research team, and all of Stripe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Has relevant experience working in financial technology particularly in payments, and/or developer experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
