Prevent network and compute “hot spots” in high-density AI clusters and improve workload fairness and throughput. PyTorch Stack Optimization Leverage advanced PyTorch capabilities including DistributedDataParallel (DDP), Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), and torch.compile. Optimize execution graphs, runtime traces, and memory usage for maximum hardware efficiency. GPU & Accelerator Utilization Apply best practices in kernel fusion, mixed-precision execution (FP16/FP8/INT8), and memory management. Reduce idle “bubble” time and drive sustained peak FLOPS utilization during training and inference. Performance Modeling & Benchmarking Build automated benchmarking suites and performance regression tests. Develop quantitative models to predict how architectural changes (e.g., attention mechanisms, batch sizes, parallelism strategies) scale across different cluster topologies. Hardware–Software Co-Design Collaborate closely with systems, infrastructure, and silicon teams to translate performance findings into actionable requirements. Influence the design of next-generation AI accelerators, NICs, and interconnects. Requirements & Qualifications Education:Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or a related field. Hands-on experience optimizing distributed ML workloads across multi-node accelerator clusters. Strong understanding of data parallelism, model parallelism, and pipeline parallelism. Deep knowledge of GPU or accelerator architectures, including compute units, memory hierarchies, and interconnects (PCIe, NVLink, or equivalents). Experience working with NCCL, RCCL, MPI, or similar collective communication frameworks. Strong understanding of high-performance networking (Ethernet, InfiniBand, RoCE) and their impact on distributed workloads. PyTorch & ML Systems Proficiency Advanced experience with PyTorch, including distributed training internals and execution tracing. Ability to diagnose and optimize framework-level and runtime bottlenecks. Comfortable debugging issues across software, firmware, and hardware boundaries. Strong proficiency in Python and C/C++. Experience building performance analysis tools, automation, and benchmarking frameworks. Ability to clearly communicate complex performance findings to cross-functional teams.
