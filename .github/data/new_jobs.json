If you're located beyond that distance, the role is fully remote. For location-specific details, please connect with our recruiting team. What You Will Do: Own the GTM budget envelope – Manage OpEx and headcount budgets for our largest teams. Ensure initiatives are fully funded and stay within burn targets, partnering with StratFin on growth, ROI, and unit economics.
