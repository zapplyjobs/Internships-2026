Much of our Lower Susquehanna work takes place at the College’s Southeast Agricultural Research and Extension Center (SEAREC) in Lancaster County.The AEC is in need of a summer conservation Geographic Information System (GIS) intern at its University Park Campus office. The intern will work collaboratively in a cohort of student summer interns at the AEC and the related Center for Agricultural Conservation Assistance Training (CACAT) at Penn State Extension.The GIS intern will assist the AEC Director, GIS Specialist, GIS Technician, and other staff in the development of a multitude of GIS-based datasets, tools, and maps to support its projects and programs. Work will include collaboration with Penn State research labs providing GIS-based decision support tools to guide agricultural conservation and restoration efforts and CACAT to conduct watershed assessments for county conservation districts that help districts prioritize farmer outreach and conservation practice adoption. These GIS-based data layers, tools, and maps will help the AEC and its many partners prioritize landowner outreach and watershed restoration efforts in watersheds of focus for the AEC, primarily in the Lower Susquehanna region. Other duties (as assigned) to assist the AEC Director and other staff. Developing GIS-based tools will be the primary responsibility of the intern, however they will also have the opportunity to participate in other AEC projects as time permits like volunteer events, educational workshops, field assessments, water quality monitoring, and site visits.
