    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figma is growing our team of passionate creatives and builders on a mission to make design accessible to all. Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you&#39;re brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you&#39;re excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for technically-minded product designers who are excited to shape how teams build together. At Figma, design isn’t just how something looks—it’s how it works, how it feels, and how it scales. Our designers are systems thinkers, prototypers, storytellers, and craftspeople who care deeply about quality and collaboration. In this role, you’ll turn ambiguity into clarity, push the product forward with engineers, PMs, and researchers, and help us invent new ways for people to design and build products together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With an eye for simplicity and craft, curiosity for complex systems, and an appetite for technical challenges, you can help define the future of how software is made.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This opportunity applies to openings of varying seniority levels across our team–including Figma Editor, AI, Interactivity, Design Systems, and Dev Tools. We’ll discuss more specifics about open roles during the interview process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to overall strategy and decision-making about product direction&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Help deliver and refine clear storytelling around product needs and opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work cross-functionally with product management, engineering, design, and research peers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create and iterate on flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity visuals, as well as provide thoughtful feedback for others doing the same so you can all do your best work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and ship high-quality features and product improvements in Figma’s core product surfaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to our design org’s culture by participating in design critiques, mentoring peers, and sharing best practices across teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of experience designing UX and UI for a software product of similar scale and complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Great attention to detail and a strong eye for visual craft, such as composition, typography, and layout&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fluency in interaction design and prototyping, to express and refine nuanced design decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of independently driving design processes from discovery through launch—balancing user needs, technical constraints, and business goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to guide decision-making with structured thinking, clearly articulated rationale, and user-centered research.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A knack for figuring out ambiguous problems in complex systems, and shaping them into simple solutions with clear goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience researching, prototyping, or building products with AI and other emerging tools to uncover new patterns for creativity and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with web technologies like HTML/CSS, prototyping tools such as Origami, or advanced Figma features like Auto Layout, Variables, and Components&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A design/development hybrid background, or experience building websites or apps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A history of working on canvas-based interfaces or tools that support creative workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prior work involving design systems, like creating, maintaining, or contributing to a design system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.
