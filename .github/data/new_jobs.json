We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: This is an amazing opportunity to use your payroll expertise to reshape our customer experience. You’ll showcase your passion for customer support by resolving tax notices while delivering a world-class customer experience. You'll act as a detective and problem-solver discovering payroll discrepancies, researching tax laws, and identifying the root cause of notices. You will be working closely with tax agencies as well as our cross-functional partner teams to reach the best outcomes for our customers and provide feedback on tools that streamline the resolution process and prevent similar issues in the future. This role is very hands-on, with an emphasis on research and analysis, excellent communication skills, and first-principles problem-solving. A strong work ethic and desire to be part of the team is critical for success, as well as the ability to retain and apply large amounts of critical information. You must also possess and take pride in high attention to detail, organization, and task management, and be comfortable working in a fast-paced, deadline-driven business environment. About the Team: The Tax Resolution team is within the Payroll Operations organization and is at the core of providing services that give our customers peace of mind. Tax Resolution exists to ensure impeccable delivery of key customer needs. There are thousands of critical operational tasks that are completed for our customers accurately and on time, every time, in a proactive and scalable manner. We collaborate, help each other, and work cross-functional in a positive environment. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Provide exceptional service to our customers. Interact professionally with our customers via email and/or phone, simplifying the tax notice experience for our customers. Research and resolve payroll tax notices on behalf of our customers with guidance from more experienced team members. Provide clear and concise case documentation. Collaborate with our Compliance, Engagement, and Tax Operations teams. Communicate with government agencies to represent Gusto and advocate for our customers under supervision. Manage your time effectively to meet set goals. Handle a queue of tax notices daily, including updating cases as needed, informing customers of any changes, and seeking assistance from peers on escalated issues. Participate in team meetings and provide support to fellow TaxRes Advocates. Here’s what we're looking for: 2-4 years of payroll experience, notice resolution experience is a plus. Ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams. Capability to manage multiple priorities within a high-volume, fast-paced environment and adapt to shifting priorities daily. Commitment to personal high standards and a desire to contribute to team and company goals. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with guidance to resolve issues from complex variables. Team player who enjoys collaborating and contributing to team success. Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, with the ability to simplify complex topics. Highly organized and proactive in improving processes. Dedicated to providing an exceptional customer experience during key moments in our customers' journey. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $23.50/hr to $28.42/hr in Denver & most major metro locations, and $28.63/hr to $33.40/hr for San Francisco & New York.
