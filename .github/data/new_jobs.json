We offer financial infrastructure and a variety of services to serve the needs of a wide range of users, from startups to enterprises, with global scale and industry-leading reliability and product quality.&amp;nbsp; All financial services businesses face a trade-off between access, which we want to expand, and risk, which we want to minimize. We use machine learning to scalably and intelligently optimize across both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. It is a key investment area with products and use cases that span merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization, identity, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies (such as LLMs and FMs) to re-imagine product experiences and developing AI Assistants and Agents both for our customers (e.g. Radar Assistant and Sigma Assistant), and also to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to building and shipping the foundational AI and machine learning systems that will power our entire product suite. Our mission is to fundamentally transform how Stripe uses ML, leveraging our extensive and rich dataset to solve some of the most challenging problems in payments and fraud. We work closely with our partners in Risk, Payments, and Support to build transformative technologies that have a direct impact on our users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From a data perspective, Stripe handles over &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-2024-update&quot;&gt;$1.4T in payments volume&lt;/a&gt; per year, which is roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product&quot;&gt;1.3% of the world’s GDP&lt;/a&gt;. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We focus on seeing how LLMs can solve some of our hardest problems in merchant risk and understanding how we can align language to our immense ocean of payments data. Some of our latest innovations have been around understanding how to best represent payments using transformers and enabling entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Machine Learning Engineer on the Foundation Model team, you&#39;ll solve some of Stripe&#39;s most challenging technical problems that span multiple teams and directly impact our research and engineering efforts around building the Foundation Models that power our payments and risk solutions .

    "description": "&lt;h2&gt;Who we are&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;About Stripe&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning at Stripe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;About the team&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Before Stripe, every growing internet platform had a payments team. Today, every growing internet platform has an Identity team to verify trustworthiness of a user. Identity verification is a core piece of economic infrastructure for online businesses that enables businesses to digitally verify the user’s Identity (through ID document, Passport, DL) for fraud, regulatory and trust &amp;amp; safety purposes. At Stripe, we&#39;re building the future of identity verification and trust in the digital economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Stripe Identity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be part of a team that&#39;s building a product with the potential to transform how trust is established in the digital world&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on challenging technical problems at a global scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to a product that will serve diverse industries, from fintech to e-commerce and beyond&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to shape the future of digital identity and fraud prevention&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/identity&quot;&gt;Identity&lt;/a&gt; end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.
