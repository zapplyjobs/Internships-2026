We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role In this role on the Applied AI team, you will lead the delivery of transformational AI solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises. You'll own high-value engagements where we collaborate directly with customers to build tailored AI agents for their most critical business processes. You will own end-to-end delivery from signed SOW through production deployment, orchestrating cross-functional teams including Engineering, Product, Design, and customer stakeholders. This is not project management—you'll navigate complex enterprise environments, remove technical and organizational blockers, and ensure we deliver measurable business outcomes while maintaining our high standards for safety and reliability. You'll work hand-in-hand with Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) who handle core technical delivery, while you own stakeholder management, delivery cadence, and organizational complexity. You'll champion our mission in the field while building the playbooks and processes that enable us to scale this emerging motion. Responsibilities: Draft Statements of Work (SOWs) alongside engineers, structuring engagements with clear scope, milestones, and success criteria. Participate in technical discovery sessions to understand customer requirements and inform engagement design. Own AI product building end-to-end: maintain and adjust roadmaps as scope evolves, identify and work through blockers, and help the team navigate delivery challenges. Drive engagement delivery from SOW signature through production deployment, ensuring milestones are met, blockers are removed, and stakeholders are aligned. Partner closely with FDEs: manage organizational complexity and facilitate their access to customer stakeholders and systems. Orchestrate cross-functional teams: coordinate Engineering, Product/Design resources, and customer teams to deliver integrated solutions on time and within scope. Manage stakeholder relationships: maintain regular cadence with customer executive sponsors, technical leads, and procurement while surfacing issues and celebrating wins. Lead delivery operations: run sprint ceremonies, milestone reviews, and progress reporting; translate technical complexity into executive-level updates. Navigate enterprise complexity: work through security reviews, legal approvals, procurement processes, and organizational dynamics that can block progress. Manage scope and change: handle scope changes, set expectations, and negotiate contract modifications when needed. Identify risks early and develop mitigation strategies; know when to escalate to leadership and provide clear context when doing so. Serve as the first line of escalation for FDEs and customer stakeholders; resolve conflicts before they impact delivery. Document engagement patterns, create repeatable frameworks, and contribute to the operational infrastructure that enables growth. Travel as needed to customer sites to build relationships, unblock issues, and demonstrate Anthropic's commitment (25-50% travel expected).

Exceptional communication skills for managing diverse stakeholders, running effective meetings, and producing clear status reporting.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
