      "job_description": "Are you fascinated by machine learning, data science, and the challenge of scaling models across complex environments? As our Architecture & Innovation Intern, you’ll dive into a forward‑looking initiative: expanding our claim complexity model beyond Maine and helping to determine how it should evolve as we introduce additional states. You’ll explore real‑world questions that don’t have straightforward answers. This is hands‑on, high‑impact work where your analysis and recommendations will directly help influence decisions. What You’ll Work On You’ll start by digging into the existing claim complexity model and understanding how it functions today. From there, you’ll explore what it would take to expand the model to additional states — including evaluating whether a unified model or multiple state‑based models is the best approach. Your work will involve: Conducting exploratory data analysis to understand differences across states Evaluating feature availability, regulatory considerations, and data consistency Assessing historical data volume and how it impacts model performance Comparing machine learning models and determining whether the current approach still fits Engineering features, defining labels, and performing statistical analysis Writing scripts to generate reports and insights Supporting documentation, research, and model‑related tasks Participating in meetings, updating scrum boards, and collaborating with the broader Architecture & Innovation team Potentially working with AWS, pipelines, testing, and source control Your findings will help shape MEMIC’s long‑term modeling strategy — and you’ll gain experience with real machine learning challenges that go far beyond classroom examples. What You Bring Pursuing an Associate’s degree or higher Experience with Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Visualization and SQL Why You’ll Love This Internship You won’t just be running models — you’ll be helping decide how MEMIC should scale them. You’ll work on meaningful, open‑ended problems that require creativity, technical skill, and strategic thinking. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ MEMIC is committed to a policy of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for all employees and qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, genetics, gender identity, veteran's status, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law.

We've created both a suite of powerful data protection applications and an open platform that's sparking an ecosystem of innovation.

Think of us as the Android of data protection: a robust platform with an open core that developers and partners can build upon, coupled with our own best-in-class applications that showcase what's possible when you reimagine security from the ground up.

This project asks how machine learning models can extract &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;generalizable structure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; from novel, systematically perturbed experimental datasets and apply it to guide exploration of unseen molecular space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this role, you will design and train models that learn the latent “grammar” governing molecular function for our system of interest. Working with a large, novel experimental dataset, you will develop architectures that integrate sequence-level information with geometric and contextual representations. The focus is not merely on improving predictive accuracy, but on uncovering the inductive biases and representational strategies that enable extrapolation—when and why models succeed in new regimes, and when they fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will explore representation learning approaches for molecular design, investigate tradeoffs between foundation-scale models and structured task-specific models, and develop insights that inform both model construction and experimental strategy. There is also an opportunity for experimental validation of model-derived hypotheses, grounding model behavior in measurable biological outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This internship is intended for students who are excited to build models that reveal structure underpinning biology — and who are motivated by contributing work that advances the interface between machine learning and experimental biology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Program Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intensive &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;12-weeks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;

      "job_description": "&lt;p&gt;At Netflix, our mission is to entertain the world. Together, we are writing the next episode - pushing the boundaries of storytelling, global fandom and making the unimaginable a reality. We are a dream team obsessed with the uncomfortable excitement of discovering what happens when you merge creativity, intuition and cutting-edge technology. Come be a part of what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s no secret that we want to entertain the world. In order to do that we first must hire and develop the best people, starting with university students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a passion for solving challenging problems and learning how to build active and static protection to manage risk to talent and content creators, then we want to talk to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Content Operations &amp;amp; Innovation organization at Netflix supports content to thrill members with efficient operational workflows and execution while leveraging our scale and innovating to deliver more value on screen. Within this organization, we are looking to host one intern on the Content Security team, within Content Risk Management, during Summer 2026. The Content Security team works diligently to protect Netflix’s content across the pitch-to-play lifecycle. This means getting involved early to secure our creative output in the pre-production, production, and post-production phases, working with both our internal teams and our third party vendors across the creative ecosystem. We also work closely with our production and events security teams within Content Risk Management. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As an intern, you’ll assist in facilitating departmental needs and will participate in a program that provides training and development intended to give you the skill set necessary to become a strong candidate for future entry-level positions in Content Security. You will also gain experience in working closely with our Production, Talent, and Events Security team giving you robust exposure to all the ways in which Netflix secures its content - both physically and digitally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You do not need prior experience to apply; once you submit your application, you’ll receive an email inviting you to complete your application by filling out an Airtable form. You’ll also be asked to submit a 300-word-maximum statement of intent (preferably in PDF format) within the form using the following prompt: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Content Security team identifies and mitigates the security risk to our content across the pitch-to-play lifecycle. We collaborate with content creators, productions, post-production vendors, security professionals, and our internal creative and engineering teams to successfully protect our Content. Tell us why you are specifically interested in learning more about Content Security, including why protecting content creation appeals to you personally and what you hope to get out of this experience.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This posting will be open for a very limited time and will be closed for new applications by February 6, so if you’re interested, please submit your application as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are currently pursuing an undergraduate degree with authorization to work in the USA and an expected graduation date between December 2026 and May/June 2027.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You have a strong interest in exploring content security, particularly at the intersection of modern cybersecurity and film/television production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are open to residing in the Los Angeles area for the duration of the internship.

Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
