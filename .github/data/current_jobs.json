This project asks how machine learning models can extract &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;generalizable structure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; from novel, systematically perturbed experimental datasets and apply it to guide exploration of unseen molecular space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this role, you will design and train models that learn the latent “grammar” governing molecular function for our system of interest. Working with a large, novel experimental dataset, you will develop architectures that integrate sequence-level information with geometric and contextual representations. The focus is not merely on improving predictive accuracy, but on uncovering the inductive biases and representational strategies that enable extrapolation—when and why models succeed in new regimes, and when they fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will explore representation learning approaches for molecular design, investigate tradeoffs between foundation-scale models and structured task-specific models, and develop insights that inform both model construction and experimental strategy. There is also an opportunity for experimental validation of model-derived hypotheses, grounding model behavior in measurable biological outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This internship is intended for students who are excited to build models that reveal structure underpinning biology — and who are motivated by contributing work that advances the interface between machine learning and experimental biology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Program Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intensive &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;12-weeks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;

For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay 0% up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applicable full salary ranges for this position, by specific state, are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City Metro Area:&lt;/p&gt;$44,000.00 - $185,000.00&lt;p&gt;Non-Metro New York state &amp; Washington state: &lt;/p&gt;$44,000.00 - $185,000.00&lt;p&gt;* For quota-based sales roles on Cisco’s sales plan, the ranges provided in this posting include base pay and sales target incentive compensation combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Employees in Illinois, whether exempt or non-exempt, will participate in a unique time off program to meet local requirements.&lt;/p&gt;",

The full salary range for certain locations is listed below. For locations not listed below, the recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. employees are offered benefits, subject to Cisco’s plan eligibility rules, which include medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, paid parental leave, short and long-term disability coverage, and basic life insurance. Please see the Cisco careers site to discover more benefits and perks.
