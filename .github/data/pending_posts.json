      "job_description": "Relay is transforming the physical world into a searchable, actionable data asset. We’ve moved beyond \"Big Radio's\" analog past to build the Relay SOAR™ Platform, which treats voice and movement as the new keyboards of the enterprise. By capturing the \"Human Signal,\" we enable frontline teams in hospitality, manufacturing, and healthcare to move from reactive chaos to proactive control. Ranked among the fastest-growing tech companies in North America, we are looking for the next generation of \"Relayers\" to help us digitize the final frontier of the workforce. Join us in Raleigh and let’s get LIT. The Role: Are you the person who is always sending your friends links to the \"newest cool AI tool\"? Do you spend your weekends experimenting with Midjourney prompts, cloning voices on ElevenLabs, or figuring out how to automate boring tasks? Relay is looking for a Generative AI Creative Intern to act as our \"Explorer in Chief.\" Our CMO and Creative Team are bullish on the power of AI to accelerate our workflows, but we need someone to test the tools, break them, and figure out how they fit into a real-world B2B marketing engine. You won’t just be designing; you’ll be researching, experimenting, and teaching. You will help us answer the question: \"How can we do this better/faster/cooler using AI?\" Our application period is open through Friday, February 13 at 5pm. Please apply today to be considered for this in semester internship! High-performing interns will be considered for a potential extension into the Summer and/or full-time employment based on alignment with business needs. What You’ll Do The Scout (Research): Monitor the AI landscape (Product Hunt, Twitter/X, Newsletters) to identify emerging tools for video, audio, image generation, and workflow automation. The Lab (Testing): Hands-on testing of new software. You will run experiments to determine whether tools such as Runway, Suno, Jasper, or Beautiful.ai can deliver brand-safe, usable results for Relay. The Teacher (Documentation): Create simple \"Cheat Sheets\" or \"Playbooks\" for our design and marketing teams. (e.g., \"Here is the exact prompt structure to get Midjourney to use Relay's brand colors.\") The Creator (Prototyping): Execute \"Pilot Projects.\" We might ask you to create a 30-second promo video entirely using AI tools to see if it’s viable, or use AI to turn one blog post into 20 social snippets. The Ethical Guardian: Help us navigate the \"Wild West\" by spotting copyright issues or security risks in the tools we test. What You’ll Have Technical Portfolio: You must demonstrate a \"Proof of Workflow\" (see below). Curiosity First: You don't need a specific degree (though Marketing, CS, or Design is great). You need an obsession with how things work. Prompt Engineering: You understand that \"garbage in, garbage out\" applies to AI. You know how to craft detailed, iterative prompts to get high-quality results. Tech Savviness: You aren't afraid of a new interface. You can jump from a video editor to a text generator to a music synthesizer without missing a beat. Critical Eye: A high bar for quality. You can distinguish between \"cool AI art\" and \"professional brand assets\" that are ready for a LinkedIn campaign. Systems Thinking: You aren't just looking for a tool; you're looking for a workflow. You understand how to connect Tool A to Tool B. Communication: You can distill complex tech talk into simple language for our marketing team. Academic Rigor and Pending Graduation: You have at least a 3.0 GPA and are a final year undergraduate student The \"Proof of Work\" Requirement To be considered, candidates must submit a \"Mini-Portfolio\" consisting of: The \"Before & After\" Case Study: Show us a raw AI output vs. a final, polished creative asset. Explain the \"edit\" you performed to make it brand-ready. The Prompt Recipe: Provide a specific prompt or series of prompts you developed to solve a complex problem (e.g., maintaining character consistency or matching a specific brand's voice). The Workflow Breakdown: A Loom video or a PDF showing how you used at least two tools together to create a finished product (e.g., generating a script in ChatGPT, voiceover in ElevenLabs, and video in Runway). Tools We’d Love You to Know (or be eager to learn) Image: Gemini, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, Dall-E 3 Video/Motion: Runway Gen-2, Pika, HeyGen Audio: ElevenLabs, Suno Productivity: ChatGPT (Advanced Data Analysis), Zapier, Perplexity Why Start Your Career at Relay? Work at the Edge of Innovation: We just secured our 100th patent. You’ll work with technologies spanning AI-driven noise suppression, real-time language translation, and advanced IoT connectivity.
