Our mission-driven team values collaboration, impact, and openness. As an intern, you’ll be part of an inclusive and supportive environment where your ideas and contributions truly matter. Your Next Challenge: Collaborate with the engineering team to develop, test, and deploy software tools that support our mission. Work on and ship production code for real-world projects involving data pipelines, web applications, or satellite imagery processing. Gain hands-on experience with technologies such as Typescript, Python, React, Kafka, Mapbox, ElasticSearch, Postgres, MongoDB, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like Google Cloud. Participate in brainstorming sessions, technical discussions, and code reviews. Contribute to the development of tools or features that extend our platform’s ability to deliver high-impact insights across domains such as marine conservation, land use, climate resilience, and disaster recovery. What You’ll Need: Undergraduate or Masters student pursuing a degree in Computer Science or a related field. Passion for software engineering and interest in environmental conservation. A strong foundation in any modern programming language. Curiosity and eagerness to learn new technologies and tackle technical challenges. Strong communication skills and ability to work in a collaborative team environment. Interest in the full product development process, including engaging with users to understand their needs and gather feedback to improve products. What You’ll Gain: Real-world experience in software engineering and exposure to state-of-the-art AI tools. Mentorship from experienced professionals who are leaders in their fields. Insight into how technology is used to address critical environmental challenges. A chance to make a meaningful impact, and use technology for good, tackling some of the planet’s most pressing environmental and humanitarian challenges. Projects: To give you a better idea of the kinds of projects you’d work on, here are some examples of our previous and current projects: Multisensor Satellite Detection Pipelines – What began as a Sentinel-2 vessel-detection system has evolved into a planetary-scale inference pipeline spanning Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat imagery. Our distributed processing stack downloads new satellite scenes as soon as they’re available, runs fine-tuned computer-vision models, and makes results visible to users within hours. Building this system meant solving hard problems in cloud-scale parallelism, planetary datasets, and GPU optimization. (Read more in our blog post here) Geospatial Annotation Tool – We built a browser-based annotation platform that lets users create training datasets across multiple imagery types and time steps. It’s used by conservation scientists and NGOs to label everything from croplands to mangroves, replacing what was once a fragmented or prohibitively expensive process. Model Fine-Tuning Platform – The OlmoEarth Platform allows users with no ML background to fine-tune our foundation models to their specific domain — whether that’s wildfire fuel mapping, crop classification, or flood detection. Engineers collaborated closely with researchers to design the orchestration, configuration, and compute management layers that make “walk-up” fine-tuning possible, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal friction. (Read more in our blog post here) AIS Data Pipeline & Track Generation – Our largest data source is a real-time feed of global AIS data, about 1k messages per second that we use to compute vessel trajectories in real-time using Kafka Streams. This data stream is great, but very messy. Our algorithms have to sift through the noise very quickly to find the signal. Our Machine Learning models take these computed trajectories as input to predict vessel behaviors. As an intern, we don’t expect you to come in knowing our tech stack. We care way more about your ability to learn and engage. But since we know you’ll ask, here is our current tech stack: React/Typescript web-apps. Python microservices, mostly HTTP APIs. Kafka streams data pipelines, on Python, and Typescript. Postgres, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Redis for data persistence. Docker / Kubernetes / Terraform on Google Cloud. PyTorch models. Physical Demands and Work Environment: The physical demands described here are representative of those that must be met by an employee to successfully perform the essential functions of this position. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the functions. Must be able to remain in a stationary position for long periods of time.

If you are driven to create a better, more sustainable future, then this is the right place for you. Software Engineering Intern - API & Cloud Microservices Team: Cloud Microservices Why this Internship Lucid Vehicles are Cloud-connected Computers-on-wheels. You’ll learn how Cloud Software and Lucid Vehicles come together: high-throughput ingestion, reliable APIs, distributed systems, and safety-minded engineering. What You’ll Do Build partner-facing APIs: Build partner-facing APIs: Implement secure, clearly versioned REST/gRPC endpoints that expose Lucid’s Cloud Vehicle OS capabilities, powering customer experiences and orchestrating lifecycle operations across the fleet. Own microservice slices: Design and extend Golang services behind those APIs (request handling, orchestration, persistence, resilience patterns). Data & storage: Model and optimize MongoDB collections, indexes, and queries for evolving, high-volume datasets. Reliability & safety: Add idempotency, pagination, retries/backoff, rate limiting/quotas, and circuit-breaker patterns; write robust unit/integration tests. Security & access control: Help implement OAuth2/client credentials or mTLS, JWT scopes/claims, API keys, audit logging, and least-privilege service RBAC. DX (Developer Experience): Publish OpenAPI/Proto specs, Postman collections, sample clients, and changelogs; contribute to a simple partner onboarding flow and sandbox test harness. Observability: Add metrics, logs, and traces (Prometheus/Grafana/Elasticsearch) and participate in SLI/SLO tracking for key endpoints. (Optional) Frontend: Contribute to Frontend (React/MUI) Minimum Qualifications BS/MS in CS/EE (in-progress) or equivalent experience. Solid programming skills in Golang (or strong in a typed language and eager to ramp on Go). Understanding of HTTP, REST/gRPC, JSON/Protobuf, and backend testing. Database fundamentals (indexes, query performance, transactions/consistency trade-offs). Clear communication and curiosity; you document decisions and ask good questions. Nice-to-Have MongoDB experience (schema design, aggregation, TTL/index strategies). API platform concepts: OpenAPI/Proto, versioning/deprecation, idempotency keys, rate limiting, quotas. Front-end development experience (React) AuthN/Z exposure: OAuth2, mTLS, JWT, service-to-service auth, secrets management. Event/messaging systems (NATS, MQTT, Kafka) and streaming/ingestion patterns. Containers/cloud: Docker, Kubernetes, Istio/Envoy, CI/CD. What Success Looks Like You ship at least one partner-facing API endpoint or microservice feature end-to-end (design, tests, observability, docs) Your code is well-tested, observable, documented, and reviewed without major rework. Partner Developer Experience artifacts (specs, samples, docs) are clear enough for another engineer to integrate with minimal back-and-forth.
