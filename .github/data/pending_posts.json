Learn more about why we are one of the Best Companies to Work for in Texas®.\nFull-Time\nNights\n7p-7a\n\nThe critical care internship gives the nurse a unique opportunity to experience a variety of critical care units before deciding which environment is the best fit. During that time you will train in each of the five clinical areas:\n\nCardiac/Cardiovascular ICU: Our Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit has 24 beds and is a team-oriented unit that provides high quality and safe care to a variety of cardiac patients, including: post open heart surgery, post percutaneous coronary intervention, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock. The CV/CICU also cares for patients requiring an intra- aortic balloon pump, continuous renal replacement therapy, ventricular assist device or ECMO. The CV/CICU is a full service critical care monitored unit, which provides an opportunity to maintain and improve skills in the overall assessment and care of the critically ill patient. Our nurses are valuable team members and help develop a culture of inclusion and respect. UMC is a teaching institution, so we value learning and development, giving you ample opportunity to expand your skills and knowledge with continued education. Our unit is fast-paced and you'll find great people working together with other professional interdisciplinary teams.\n\nMedical ICU: Offers the opportunity to explore a wide array of pathophysiology. The patient population includes patients with multi-system organ failure, respiratory failure, diabetic emergencies, drug overdoses, autoimmune crisis, and many other critically ill patients. The medical ICU consists of 32 beds with an emphasis on teamwork. The usage of evidence based practice is prominent within this unit as they strive to incorporate the most innovative and patient safe environment. AACN healthy work environment initiatives are incorporated as well within this unit to ensure all six standards are met to achieve authentic leadership, skilled and effective communication, true collaboration, effective decision making, appropriate staffing, and meaningful recognition.\n\nBurn ICU: The Timothy J. Harnar Burn Center is one of under 70 verified burn centers in the United States. UMC's coverage area encompasses a vast expanse of New Mexico, Western Oklahoma, Southern Kansas and all of West Texas making it the third largest geographic area of all regional burn centers in the country. We are in the top 15 busiest burn centers in the nation, caring for not only burns, but also any soft tissue problems including snakebites, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and surgical wounds. Through our affiliation with Texas Tech's School of Medicine, UMC's Burn Center also is a leading force in research on burn treatment. The center has 6 critical care beds and 8 intermediate care beds. We keep our burn center patients in the unit for their entire hospital stay so we have every level of acuity. We care for patients of all ages. Nurses in the Burn Center are also trained to work in the Trauma and Surgical ICU.\n\nTrauma and Surgical ICU: The Trauma and Surgical ICU offers a variety of opportunities for advanced patient care in the region's only Level I Trauma Center. More than 50% of the patients admitted to the 20-bed unit are multiple trauma patients. There is a large neurosurgery and general surgery patient population. The unit is a fast-paced unit with many opportunities for learning. The physician leadership of the unit are trauma/critical care trained surgeons.

While in the Emergency Center you will orient to all areas of the Emergency Center.\n\nTriage : Triage training will offer you the best view of how the emergency center flows. As a triage nurse you are the decision maker for each patient that is waiting to be seen. You are instructed on the ESI 5 tier index triage system and will begin using this in making decisions on how sick a patient may be and if it is safe for them to wait or not. This again is the most important part of your orientation, because it will carry over into your patient care as a primary nurse to all patients in the Emergency Center. As an experienced nurse, you may have previously used this system and therefore, you will adapt to how this Emergency Center utilizes ESI.\n\nGeneral Medical : Offers a comprehensive experience caring for all types of patients. You will care for patients that are stable to emergently needing care. This area is where you will learn the flow of the Emergency Center and all of the documentation and functionality of the EC.\n\nSuper-Fast Track : Offers the opportunity to explore patients that are very stable and only need one to two diagnostics to come to a disposition. This is a very fast paced area and will really offer you a chance to do focused assessments rather than extensive assessments. You will become very proficient in learning how to focus on the true problem the patient has.\n\nCritical Care : This zone of the Emergency Center offers the opportunity to explore a wide array of pathophysiology. This patient population includes multi-system organ failure, respiratory failure, diabetic emergencies, drug overdoses, autoimmune crisis, and many other critically ill patients.\n\nTrauma Care : Offers a variety of opportunities for advanced patient care in the region’s only Level I Trauma Center. You will care for patients immediately after a traumatic event and will assist the surgery team, orthopedics, neurosurgery team and burn team deciding the further plan of care for that patient. The Burn Center is the region’s only verified burn center. You will care for burns and other soft tissue injuries such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and snakebites.\n\nRegistered professional nurse who assesses, implements or delegates, plans, and evaluates total nursing care and functions in accordance with established philosophy, providing and directing patient care for a group of patients.
