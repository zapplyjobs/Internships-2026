JOB DESCRIPTION AND POSITION REQUIREMENTS:The Department of Physics at Penn State is seeking to hire Part-time undergrad research supports to work with Dr. Stephanie Wissel and her lab. These individuals will assist Dr. Wissel with support research in ultrahigh energy neutrinos. Neutrinos can act as probes of explosive astrophysical objects and help identify the origin of cosmic rays – the most energetic charged particles in the universe. However, because energetic neutrinos are rare and interact only weakly, enormous detectors are required to observe a substantial flux of neutrinos. By taking advantage of the long propagation lengths of radio signals generated when neutrinos interact with the Earth, radio detection techniques build can the volumes needed. Neutrinos interact with matter in the Earth to produce particle showers in either ice or air and the showers radiate in radio frequencies. The successful candidate will work on one of several experimental efforts designed to detect neutrinos in this way. BEACON and HERON aim to detect air showers from a high-elevation mountain after they interact in the Earth, while PBR aims to detect those events from an ultra-long duration balloon launched from New Zealand.  RNO-G, ARA, and IceCube-Gen2 aim to detect ice showers from neutrinos using radio antennas embedded in polar ice at both Summit Station in Greenland and at the South Pole in Antarctica. PUEO searches for both types of neutrino interactions by flying a balloon over ice in Antarctica.  Pennsylvania State University is committed to and accountable for advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and sustainability in all of its forms.

Major companies with Austin campuses, such as Dell, National Instruments, Apple, IBM, Samsung, Google and many others, continue to recruit Cockrell School students at a remarkable rate, launching thousands of successful careers and developing Texas Engineers into industry leaders.At UT Austin, we say “What starts here changes the world.”  As a member of the university community, you will be part of an organization that is internationally recognized for our academic programs and research. Your work will have meaning and make a difference not only in the lives of our faculty, staff, and students, but also those who are impacted by our first-class academic and research programs.UT Austin provides outstanding employee benefits and total rewards packages that include:Competitive health benefits (employee premiums covered at 100%, family premiums at 50%)Voluntary Vision, Dental, Life, and Disability insurance optionsGenerous paid vacation, sick time, and holidaysTeachers Retirement System of Texas, a defined benefit retirement plan, with 7.75% employer matching fundsAdditional Voluntary Retirement Programs: Tax Sheltered Annuity 403(b) and a Deferred Compensation program 457(b)Flexible spending account options for medical and childcare expensesRobust free training access through LinkedIn Learning, plus professional conference opportunitiesTuition assistanceExpansive employee discount program, including athletic ticketsFree access to UT Austin's libraries and museums with staff ID cardFree rides on all UT Shuttle and Austin CapMetro buses with staff ID cardPurposeThe Postdoctoral Fellow will lead research in AI-driven and self-driving transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as part of the advanced materials characterization and autonomous discovery initiatives within the Texas Materials Institute (TMI) at The University of Texas at Austin. This position focuses on developing the next generation of intelligent electron microscopy systems that integrate machine learning, robotic control, and real-time data analysis to achieve autonomous imaging and interpretation of complex materials systems. The Fellow will design and execute experiments that advance the frontier of self-optimizing microscopy, including automated alignment, adaptive focusing, drift correction, and AI-assisted atomic structure recognition. The role involves building and training deep-learning models for TEM image reconstruction and interpretation, linking image features to local chemistry, defects, and dynamic transformations under varying environmental or beam conditions. The successful candidate will work closely with faculty and research staff to help establish TMI’s new AI-integrated microscopy hub as a national leader in self-driving electron microscopy.This position will operate as a core part of a larger AI-robotic materials discovery program at TMI that couples liquid-phase synthesis, high-throughput sample processing, and autonomous characterization. The TEM postdoctoral fellow will collaborate with companion postdocs specializing in liquid-phase synthesis and thin-film formation, integrating structural characterization directly with compositional and processing data streams. A central aspect of this work will be to interface TEM workflows with the microdroplet printing system for high-throughput sample deposition onto TEM grids or micro-electrode arrays, enabling statistically rich structure–property correlations across thousands of printed materials. The Fellow will also contribute to the development of robotic sample preparation and automated sample-loading systems, including a robot arm-based TEM grid handling and holder-loading setup, to achieve continuous, unsupervised operation of the microscope. Working within this integrated ecosystem, the Fellow will help connect real-time TEM data to cloud-based digital twins and the broader AI framework controlling synthesis and electrochemical testing, creating a closed experimental–computational feedback loop for autonomous materials discovery.The Postdoctoral Fellow will be expected to lead and publish independent research, collaborate across disciplines of materials science, electron microscopy, chemistry, and data science, and contribute to the mentorship of graduate students and junior researchers.
