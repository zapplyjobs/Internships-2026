The CV/CICU also cares for patients requiring an intra- aortic balloon pump, continuous renal replacement therapy, ventricular assist device or ECMO. The CV/CICU is a full service critical care monitored unit, which provides an opportunity to maintain and improve skills in the overall assessment and care of the critically ill patient. Our nurses are valuable team members and help develop a culture of inclusion and respect. UMC is a teaching institution, so we value learning and development, giving you ample opportunity to expand your skills and knowledge with continued education.

Harnar Burn Center is one of under 70 verified burn centers in the United States. UMC's coverage area encompasses a vast expanse of New Mexico, Western Oklahoma, Southern Kansas and all of West Texas making it the third largest geographic area of all regional burn centers in the country. We are in the top 15 busiest burn centers in the nation, caring for not only burns, but also any soft tissue problems including snakebites, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and surgical wounds.

The physician leadership team consists of critical care boarded anesthesiologists who are champions for the nursing staff. The nurse-to-patient ratio is optimally 2 patients per 1 nurse. This can be adjusted by the charge nurse according to patient and staffing needs.

The CV / CICU also cares for patients requiring an intra- aortic balloon pump, continuous renal replacement therapy, ventricular assist device or ECMO. The CV / CICU is a full service critical care monitored unit, which provides an opportunity to maintain and improve skills in the overall assessment and care of the critically ill patient. Our nurses are valuable team members and help develop a culture of inclusion and respect. UMC is a teaching institution, so we value learning and development, giving you ample opportunity to expand your skills and knowledge with continued education. Our unit is fast-paced and you’ll find great people working together with other professional interdisciplinary teams.\n\nMedical ICU : Offers the opportunity to explore a wide array of pathophysiology. The patient population includes patients with multi-system organ failure, respiratory failure, diabetic emergencies, drug overdoses, autoimmune crisis, and many other critically ill patients. The medical ICU consists of 32 beds with an emphasis on teamwork. The usage of evidence based practice is prominent within this unit as they strive to incorporate the most innovative and patient safe environment.

Harnar Burn Center is one of under 70 verified burn centers in the United States. UMC’s coverage area encompasses a vast expanse of New Mexico, Western Oklahoma, Southern Kansas and all of West Texas making it the third largest geographic area of all regional burn centers in the country. We are in the top 15 busiest burn centers in the nation, caring for not only burns, but also any soft tissue problems including snakebites, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and surgical wounds. Through our affiliation with Texas Tech's School of Medicine, UMC's Burn Center also is a leading force in research on burn treatment. The center has 6 critical care beds and 8 intermediate care beds. We keep our burn center patients in the unit for their entire hospital stay so we have every level of acuity. We care for patients of all ages. Nurses in the Burn Center are also trained to work in the Trauma and Surgical ICU.\n\nTrauma and Surgical ICU : The Trauma and Surgical ICU offers a variety of opportunities for advanced patient care in the region’s only Level I Trauma Center.

The unit is a fast-paced unit with many opportunities for learning. The physician leadership of the unit are trauma / critical care trained surgeons. The unit has many active committees with bedside nurses making advancements in patient care and work environment. The environment encourages evidence based practice and research. Nurses working in the Trauma and Surgical ICU are also trained to work in the region’s only Burn Center.\n\nNeuro ICU : The Neuro ICU is a 16 bed critical care inpatient unit providing nursing care for adolescent, adult, and geriatric patients meeting the admission criteria. The Neuro ICU provides high quality care to critically ill and neurologically injured patients in a team oriented multidisciplinary work environment. Our focus is to improve healthcare through research and education for patients with immediately life-threatening neurological problems such as intracranial hemorrhages, brain tumors, spinal disease, and post neurosurgical interventions. The Neuro ICU’s interdisciplinary approach considers all aspects of a person’s life, by providing holistic care. The physician leadership team consists of critical care boarded anesthesiologists who are champions for the nursing staff. The nurse-to-patient ratio is optimally 2 patients per 1 nurse. This can be adjusted by the charge nurse according to patient and staffing needs. This delivery care model dictates that the ideal candidate must be able to coordinate needed patient care with all disciplines, and must be able to provide excellent service to patients and families by coordinating the necessary patient care with all members of the multidisciplinary team.\n\nAssesses, implements or delegates, plans, and evaluates total nursing care and functions in accordance with established philosophy, providing and directing patient care for a group of patients.

At Transfyr, we are building the infrastructure to make real-world scientific work legible, transferable, and reproducible.\n\nModern science is capable of extraordinary outcomes, but much of the most important insights never become explicit: how experiments are actually executed, protocols drift, how experts make gametime decisions on the fly, why experiments fail on Tuesdays. This tacit knowledge is rarely captured, making it difficult to reliably reproduce results, much less hand off protocols to new team members or collaborators. We believe our systematic failure to capture tacit knowledge is holding back the entire industry.\n\nWe’re building systems that operate directly in real laboratory environments to elucidate, capture, and interpret this missing information. Our platform records and analyzes multimodal data about how scientific work is performed and turns it into durable, operational knowledge. In doing so, we are also building the world’s largest commercial dataset on real-world scientific execution.\n\nThis foundation is critical not only for driving elite human performance today, but for enabling meaningful automation tomorrow. Physical AI systems cannot learn from outcomes alone; they require rich, grounded records of how work is actually done in the real world.\n\nWant to learn more? You can read some of our writings here.\n\nThe Role\n\nInterns at Transfyr are embedded members of the technical team. You will work on real systems alongside software engineers, AI/ML engineers, perception engineers, and scientists, contributing directly to products and infrastructure that run in live laboratory environments.\n\nThis is not a shadowing role or a collection of toy projects. Interns are expected to take ownership of scoped problems, make progress independently, and ship work that matters.\n\nWe are open to summer internships, term time internships, or flexible arrangements depending on availability and fit.\n\nWhat You’ll Accomplish With Us\n• Build Real Systems: Work on real technical problems across software, data, AI, or perception depending on your interests and strengths.\n• Ship Work That Matters: Contribute code, experiments, or systems that are used by the team and evolve over time.\n• Learn by Doing: Prototype quickly, test ideas against real data or real environments, and iterate based on failure.\n• Grounded Collaboration: Work closely with engineers and scientists to understand how requirements emerge from reality rather than clean specs.\n• Own Your Projects: Take ownership of defined projects and push them forward with guidance and feedback from the team.\n• Grow on Frontier Systems: Learn how frontier technical systems are built, evaluated, and maintained in ambiguous, fast moving environments.\n\nWho You Are\n• High Agency: Highly motivated and biased toward action. You take initiative and do not wait for perfect instructions.\n• Comfortable in Ambiguity: Comfortable operating with incomplete context and learning what you need as you go.\n• Deeply Curious: Curious about how real systems work and motivated to understand problems deeply.\n• Fast Iteration: Able to take feedback, iterate quickly, and improve your work.\n• Driven by Challenge: Excited by hard problems and willing to put in focused effort when it matters.\n• Builder Mindset: Someone with a builder or founder mindset who wants responsibility, not just exposure.\n\nWhat You Know\n• Technical Foundation: Currently pursuing or recently completed a degree in computer science, engineering, robotics, math, or a related technical field.\n• Programming Fundamentals: Strong programming fundamentals.\n• Systems Exposure: Some exposure to software systems, data pipelines, machine learning, computer vision, or robotics through coursework or projects.\n• Learning Velocity: You do not need deep expertise in all of these areas. We care more about fundamentals, curiosity, and learning velocity.\n\nOther Things We Like To See\n• A passion for and experience in science\n• A passion for and experience with AI\n• Demonstrated experience working in fast-moving/ambiguous environments (like startups!)\n\nThe Basics\n• Interns receive market compensation with the opportunity to earn startup equity with a full time offer.\n• Internships do not typically qualify for fringe benefits (e.g. health insurance), but exceptions may be made if the circumstances are appropriate\n\nApply now\n\nSee more open positions at Transfyr Bio\n\nPrivacy policyCookie policy\n• Portfolio\n• Team\n• Jobs\n• News\n• Contact\n• INVESTORS\n\nWe’re moving fast.
